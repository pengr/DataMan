And when humanity came, I at once became the most delicate, subtle, and powerful medium for the expression of emotions.\n\nIn all ages, I have inspired people with hope, kindled their love, given a voice to their joys, cheered them on to valorous deeds, and soothed them in times of despair. I have played a great part in the drama of life, whose end and purpose is the complete perfection of human nature. Through my influence, humanity has been uplifted, sweetened, and refined. With the aid of human beings, I have become a Fine Art. I have a myriad of voices and instruments.\n\nI am in the hearts of all and on their tongues, in all lands among all peoples; the ignorant and unlettered know me no less than the rich and the learned. For I speak to all in a language that everyone can feel. Even the deaf hear me if they but listen to the voices of their own souls. I am the food of love. I have taught people gentleness and peace, and I have led them onward to heroic deeds. I am comfort for the lonely, and I harmonize the discord of crowds. I am spirit. I AM MUSIC.\n\n\u2014 Anonymous\n\n_Foreword_\n\nThe search for meaning lies at the heart of most religious traditions. Don Campbell has been on a lifelong journey of meaning searching and meaning making, exploring the dynamic of sound and music in human life. As a priest and pastor for nearly four decades, I've been privileged to both witness and participate in his search for and enunciation of meanings.\n\nWe have explored the intonation of chants, the rhythms of tribal drumming, and the nuances of dance and movement to sound. Sitting in on symphonies and recitals, we've both experienced the soaring delights of virtuosity and technical acumen as well as the subtle subtexts of musical structure. But he has never lost the sheer wonder of the creation of music and its incipient messages of hope and passion, courage and sorrow, or despair and dread. Implicit in these architectures of sound is the ongoing attempt to make meaning and speak of it clearly and without creed, dogma, or belief system. It's perhaps this crosscutting exploration of soundings that makes Don's work both a theological expedition and a philosophical adventure enabling the journey of meaning making to be accessed by all.\n\nThe world is constantly searching for meaning, and Don's exploration into the soundings of the ages adds a great deal to our canon of experience. His words have directed me to a deeper appreciation for\u2014and acceptance of\u2014daily musical phenomenon as explorations into faith and community. Sitting in the midst of a chanting congregation in a township in southern Africa as the rhythm guide led us to the ecstatic expectation of the reading and preaching of the holy word, I remembered Don's documented evidence of the role of rhythm in raising consciousness. My expectation for and receptivity of the \"holy\" was elevated and enhanced in the moment.\n\nWatching the ecstatic rhythm maker raised up by the sheer power of the chant and drumming on hymnbooks, I found that I, too, was newly opened to receive the holy word. Was it the thrumming of the women or the stomping feet of the men that created the sacred space to hear? I know not. That it preached volumes and lifted me to recognizing implicit meanings, I cannot deny.\n\nDon's observations and syntheses bear witness to the fact that music and sound are essential precursors to theology and metaphysics\u2014to helping humankind articulate the meaning of meaning itself. The sound and the fury generated by theological disputes of organized religion can be mitigated by tones and rhythms that can massage the soul, lead to visions of paradise, or warn us of the hell to come.\n\nIf you're a searcher for meaning or one charged by the community to articulate or enunciate value, this volume may give you a glimpse or remind you of a poignant memory of the value of sound in informing your faith and experience. Without dogma or creed, Don's current exploration reveals a larger vision of our experience than we perhaps are ready to consider.\n\nBut consider this: Some years ago, I stumbled across"</details> | 1024 | Book | 61911 | 3.2410825665 | 0.5207841033 | 2.0078097052 | 0.9043614729 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

Linguistic diversity has always meant that we pay attention to things differently because of how language shapes our thinking.\nNonetheless, Leighton weaves her theories beautifully \u2014 introducing and connecting each point carefully with multiple well-known examples and supporting arguments and counter-arguments. Sometimes, the web gets confusingly dense but she soon pulls it all back together again with a smooth summary. Her sensitivity to and awareness of sound come through in her own language too. Consider the poetics of these three sentences describing how sound is heard:\nFor the sound we hear is already in medias res, a passenger through time, cut off from its cause and quickly lost as it fades. To think about hearing is therefore to have to think without fixities and boundaries, in the flux of time that also runs through our very sentences for thinking. Heard in time, and then lost in time, sound quickly traverses the spectrum from closely sensed object to mere faded after ring, remembered and interpreted in the struck quiet it leaves behind.\nThere are many other descriptions of hearing sound as Leighton drives home the key point about how an \"auditory imagination\" opens up many possibilities for both the writer and the reader.\nThis kind of imaginative listening that Leighton demonstrates so masterfully throughout the book is not only a form of cognition but also a physical experience as we read or write literary texts. It's about much more than an aesthetic response to literature. Being more alert and attuned to the several layers of sounds in such texts not only deepens our pleasure and understanding of them but also becomes a complex mode of thinking.\nBeyond aural attention, Leighton says, \"hearing things\" in literature is really a long, rich tradition of \"a form of artfully performed invention\". Approaching literature and poetry with this mindset and skill-set of intense, creative listening also makes us more actively engaged writers, readers, and critics. A written work, after all, is the writer's response to an imaginative voice and his/her invitation to readers to listen. And texts even listen/speak to other texts over time through quotations, allusions, and similarities of language. When we read, there's both a reading self and a listening and watching self. So that, in the end, the writer, the reader, and the text form an interactive complex which requires ongoing listening and interpretation by the reader.\nRegarding criticism, Leighton makes an excellent point about how the language of criticism doesn't even have broadly-accepted or well-known conceptual categories to help us think appropriately about hearing and listening in literary works:\n\u2026 the ear is subservient to the eye, and sound subservient to rationality and argument \u2026 our main critical metaphors \u2014 vision, insight, image, and imagination \u2014 are predominantly derived from the eye and that we lack the equivalents for what the ear can do. Certainly, there are no single words for innerly hearing to match the inwardness of vision or insight.\nIn a world where our dwindling attention spans cause our thoughts to flutter from one distraction to the next, listening to (or even looking at) literary works with such attentiveness is akin to meditation. Surely, it can help retrain our listening faculty to be more focused so that we are better at receiving, retaining, interpreting, and communicating knowledge/information.\nThis is one of those rare books where we find ourselves changing our approach to how we read even as we're reading. On every page, Leighton works skillfully to demystify how sound works in literature and how we can pay better attention to it. Yet, she also frequently emphasizes the \"inexplicable mystery of sound\" or its \"kept promises which may never be disclosed\" as one of the main attractions of literary reading and writing because it \"instigates, inspires, and then recharges the act of interpretation.\"\nFor writers and readers everywhere, this is a valuable guide to listening to sound in literature so that listening itself becomes an act of creation. So that we might, in our reading and writing, create sounds alive with rhythm and beat, recurrence and repetition, call and recall, inflection and intonation, murmur and hum, echo and vibration, accent and cadence, weight and resonance, shape and structure, grammar and syntax, memory and imagination, message and medium, content and form, fact and fiction, idea and metaphor, substance and style.\nTAGS angela leighton belknap press book review harvard university press hearing things literary criticism non-fiction pmpick review\nHearing Things: The Work of Sound"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 24557 | 3.0328919013 | 0.6013623895 | 2.6570874077 | 1.0656464295 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

One who loved.\n\nWho loved her.\n\nStaggered by the knowledge, she poured everything she had into the kiss, needing to show him that whatever he felt was returned, equally. Then his mouth slid from hers to trail down her throat, over her shoulder. All thought, all reason, skittered away.\n\nIn a warm, slippery pool of silk and satin, he showed her what it was to ache for someone. To yearn for the sharp, thin point of pain the poets call ecstasy. Her hips arched under his, desperately offering. But he only continued that tormenting journey over her with teasing lips and gentle hands.\n\nWhen his tongue flicked under the line of lace that clung tenuously to her breasts, she moaned, pressing an urgent hand to the back of his head. The taste there\u2014honey, dampened by her arousal\u2014nearly unraveled the taut knot of his control. So he pleased them both, closing a greedy mouth over that firm, scented swell.\n\nGasping out with pleasure, she bucked under him, straining for more, her nails digging heedlessly into his back as she whimpered and struggled for what was just out of reach. Maddened by her response, he brought his mouth to hers again, crushing her lips as he slithered a hand down to cup the heat between her thighs. Prayers and pleas trembled on her tongue, but before she could voice them, he slipped under the silk to stroke.\n\nThe unbearable pleasure shattered. Fractured lights, whirling colors, spun behind her eyes to blind her. She heard herself cry out; his name was nearly a sob. Then there was his groan, a sound of sweet satisfaction as her body went limp in release.\n\nNever before. Her hands slid away from him, boneless. Sweet Lord, never like this. She felt weak, wrecked, weepy. As her breath sobbed out, as her eyes fluttered closed, they both knew that her mind, her body, were totally his for the taking.\n\nHe'd never felt stronger. Her wild response, her absolute surrender, filled him with a kind of intense power he'd never experienced before. Silk rustled against silk as he drew the teddy down, tossed it aside. Her skin, slick with passion, glowed in the shadows. He touched where he chose, watching, fascinated, as his own hands molded her. Gold against ivory. He tasted wherever he liked, feeling her muscles quiver involuntarily as he traced openmouthed kisses over her rib cage, down to her stomach. Heat to heat.\n\nThen, wanting that instant of sheer pleasure again, he drove her up a second time, shuddering himself as her body convulsed and flowed with the crest of the wave.\n\nAt last, unable to wait a moment longer, he slipped inside that hot, moist sheath. Her groan of stunned delight echoed his own.\n\nSlowly, as in a dream, her arms lifted to wrap around him. She rose to meet him, to take him deep. They moved gently at first, treasuring the intimacy, willing to prolong it. But need outpaced them, driving them faster, until, thrust for thrust, they sprinted toward the final crest.\n\nHis hand fisted in her hair as the last link of control snapped clean. Her name exploded from his lips like an oath as he emptied himself into her.\n\nShe wondered how she could ever have thought herself experienced. While it was true she hadn't been with as many men as some thought, she hadn't come to Alexi an innocent.\n\nYet things had happened tonight that had never happened before. And, because she was a woman who understood herself well, she knew that nothing she had experienced here would happen again\u2014unless it was with him.\n\nRelaxed now, she rubbed her cheek over his chest, content to remain as she'd been since he rolled over and dragged her across him. Tucked in the cocoon of his arms, she felt as cozy as a cat, and she arched lazily as he ran a hand down her spine.\n\n\"Will you tell me again?\" she asked.\n\n\"What?\"\n\nShe pressed her lips"</details> | 1024 | Book | 52075 | 3.0109770944 | -1.1230129343 | -1.2208251201 | 0.0888318938 | O | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 |

He tells how each person has a melody that guides them to their unique songline, which is a grid covering the world. Simply, once you've found your song and songline, you can't ever be lost.\n\nOver the past 26 years, I've worked closely with those living and dying from the effects of HIV and AIDS. Early on when there was no treatment, the focus was on the need for reaching deeply into the souls and hearts of the affected to find the keys of healing and hope. I recall that one evening at a religious service, I challenged the gathering with the question prompted by Chatwin's The Songlines: \"So what is your song? Which song informs you of who you are?\"\n\nIn the pregnant silence that followed, a voice burst forth from the rear of the church with this lyric: \"Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so...\" Whereupon the whole group burst into song, singing this sacred lullaby of identity and ownership, pouring out healing balm upon us all. Was there a transformation that night? Absolutely. I never imagined again that those living with and dying from AIDS were far from hope and solace. We weren't abandoned in the midst of the disease! This was my healing, which has informed me daily as I've extended this work around the world.\n\nThe sounds of faith\u2014from Sufi chants to Hindu mantras\u2014remind us that the music of the spheres is in our bones before it reaches our minds. The gentle tap of the sounding stick in a Buddhist temple enters our hearts before our intellect. Music and sound offer a pathway to find and make meaning before all the words of witness and testimony can be offered. The subtle sound of our mother's perpetual heartbeat, resonating while we're in the womb, provides the assurance and instills in us the hope that the very heart of God will receive and embrace us at last\u2014all this before we can speak.\n\nI recommend this book to you as one who still searches and yearns for wholeness and grace in everyday living. May peace be yours always; but more important, may the sounds and rhythms of life pulse in you, lifting you to renewal.\n\n\u2014 the Reverend Ted Karpf,  \ncanon, Washington National Cathedral  \nofficer, World Health Organization\n\nIntroduction  \nA CALL TO FAITH\n\n**Faith. Hope. Belief. Devotion.\n\nMy exploration into consciousness and faith began more than 30 years ago when I met my lifelong spiritual advisor in Jerusalem. As an Anglican priest, he'd lived in and created an ashram in India and was a key participant in establishing dialogue between Muslims, Christians, and Jews. He held weekly meditations on Hindu scripture and served Mass at Saint Anne's chapel in the ancient walls of the holy city. He took me to Sabbath prayer services in synagogues and would stop in his tracks when he heard the daily call to prayer from the towers in the eastern part of the city. Murray Rogers deepened my life, my ability to listen, and my faith. But to sustain it, he said, I needed to become a spiritual archeologist by using my musical tools\u2014only then could I excavate the layers of spirit within many faiths.\n\nNearly every year, I've reflected on some of the primary questions he asked me:\n\n\u2022 What spirit of belief has been constant in your life?\n\n\u2022 When did you have great moments of enlightenment and inspiration?\n\n\u2022 When did you question your beliefs and those of your family and friends?\n\n\u2022 What have been the steadfast, unwavering ways for you to feel inspired for most of your life?\n\n\u2022 What phases have you been through to find growth and maturity in your faith?\n\n\u2022 What kind of startling event has happened to you to awaken the deep concerns of mortality?\n\nThese are the questions that continually shape the decisions and actions I've taken in my life. Every decade has challenged me through death, illness, and the human relations that take place in work, love, and music making.\n\nHunters, fishermen, mothers, priests,"</details> | 1024 | Book | 61911 | 3.0109770944 | 0.5046684461 | 1.8708526898 | 0.6130080029 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

The eight sections, arranged over a hillside behind the property, include a herb garden, Victorian herbaceous borders and the Zig-Zaggy, inspired by Dante's Inferno. The High Walk is particularly impressive in spring with wild spring beds of flowers giving way to fine views across lapping Coniston Water.\nRuskin had an ability to link complex issues, such as social justice, economics and conservation, with great clarity. Brantwood was always a place of warmth, contemplation and debate.\nToday hosts a series of courses in art, literature and horticulture, themes much loved by its patron, and smart new accommodation is available in a self-catering holiday cottage complete with the views looking past the tiny jetty and across tranquil Coniston Water to the village pubs of Coniston beyond, and the original Victorian bath that inspired Ruskin's blue-sky thinking. Erudition was his gift to the movement and Brantwood remains a centre of learning as his legacy. Ruskin wrote:\n\"The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world is to see something and tell what it saw in a plain way.\"\nFrom the ivory towers above Coniston Water, I choose to end my journey through Romanticism by immersing myself in the original spirit that inspired its founders.\nI head back towards the North Lakes, following near-deserted country roads beyond the fringes of the National Park to find the daffodils blossoming the southwest bank of Ullswater. Shorter and stubbier than other varieties, their yellow heads are pushing upwards in search of spring.\nThe frost can permeate into May around these parts but I can already feel nature stirring in early April: the snow melt on the top of the St Sunday crag, Canadian geese chattering over Norfolk Island and, most of all, the golden host beside the dark-watered ribbon lake. I spend a moment admiring the views from what is known locally as Dora's Wood, before taking the Ullswater Steamer towards Pooley Bridge.\nThe mist-shrouded lake has a spectral quality, the changing of the seasons heralding new life around me.\n\"I'm constantly intrigued by the complexity of Ullswater \u2013 every minute of every day,\" says Christian Grammer, skipper for Ullswater Steamers as we cruise past Glencoyne Bay, explosions of snowdrops and early-flowering daffodils peppering the banks with tiny dashes of their radiant hues. \"She has a personality all of her own.\"\nI finish my walk through the landscapes that informed and inspired Wordsworth's work, heading up to the waterfalls at Aira Force in the shadow of Gowbarrow Fell. The trail, immortalised by Wordsworth in The Somnambulist (1833), takes me through a wood of Irish Yew and Silver Fir, inhabited by red squirrel and red deer. It is tranquil yet deliciously alive.\nIt took something as simple as spring flowers to spark a new cultural movement. Here, surrounded by the stirring of spring high above Ullswater, I too feel the power of nature in the North Lakes as something tangible, something immense, something that could truly change the world. The nature makes me feel alive.\n\"No part of the country is more distinguished by its sublimity,\" wrote Wordsworth.\nSome two centuries on, his words still ring true.\n* This store was commissioned in 2013 by TRVL magazine; I first blogged about this commission in On the trail of the Romantics.\nLiked this?

The small wooden structures with unearthly icons of saints and prophets held that strange, yet obvious, state of spirituality even when there was no ritual or chanting.\n\nNext, I visited Armenia, where the magical choral music of Komitas instantly covered me with rich spiritual fabrics of sound, finely textured and smooth; and then I traveled to the ancient monastic world of Mount Athos. In the 1970s, there was neither electricity nor automotive transportation on this 30-mile-long peninsula in the northern part of Greece on the Aegean Sea. It was completely dedicated to prayer, reflection, and worship\u2014old monks lived in hovels on the cliff as pure hermits and dozens of monasteries were scattered over the hills and valleys. By hiking unmarked trails, I could sing, chant, and meditate on the slopes of the holy mountain. At about four o'clock one morning at the Great Lavra, the mother monastery, I heard enough Kyrie Eleisons (\"Lord, Have Mercy\") to fill a hundred churches for a thousand years. In the sacred buildings, I could sense an almost tangible quality of being. Whether in these isolated, ancient structures of medieval Christianity or in a Zen Buddhist temple in a remote forest in Japan, there was a distinct feeling, an energetically subtle incense wafting. It was this invisible sensation that continued my spiritual excavations.\n\nFrom Greece, I played organs in cathedrals in France and climbed to the belfries of the great bell towers of Belgium to play the carillons\u2014and my heart and ears are still ringing from those experiences. I traveled to Spain to hear the boys' choir at Montserrat, the great shrine and monastery devoted to the Black Madonna. Then I journeyed north to England, where I heard the magnificent cathedral choirs at Winchester, Ely, Wells, York, and Salisbury.\n\nI continued to the northern part of Scotland to the Findhorn community, where I performed as pianist in a concert with two cellists. That recital of the Handel concertos was the most mystical experience I've ever had at the keyboard\u2014spirit played me. It was the closest I've ever been to levitation and exaltation.\n\nThe music took place in the meditation room, which in the early years at Findhorn was in a house. Chairs were placed in a semicircle; a few Impressionist paintings adorned the walls. A grand piano, the focal point in the middle of the room, and a candle were all that created the atmosphere in the vibrating, quiet place, similar to what I could feel in some churches and monasteries. This physical presence, a quiet harmony, provided proof of spirit.\n\nI traveled more than 20,000 miles each of those summers, and I became more curious about this world of spirit and sound. I listened to shamans in Siberia, instrumentalists in Bukhara and Alma-Ata (Almaty), and Russian choirs in Kiev. Within the next decade, I heard the spiritual singers of Brazil invoke the Virgin Mary over a span of eight hours and listened to the raspy voices of shamans in the Amazon sing from the trees. Foreign and familiar spirits led my search for the remarkable in sacred music.\n\nHow often are all of us just wanting to be home and filled with spirit, allowing our vessel of mind, heart, and body to feel complete?\n\nPRAYER**\n\n_Heal these nations, their races, their face  \nTo love each other and spirits embrace.  \nHeal this earth of forests and seas,  \nThat we never misuse its bounty and gleam.  \nHeal this spirit, this breathing of Light,  \nThat our actions and movements be ever right.  \nHeal us again and again, forever each breath.  \nLet spirit sing in every corner of the world.  \nAmen_\n\n**Sarah\n\nIn all Abrahamic faiths, Sarai is the most interesting woman in early recorded history.

Oui!'\nThis extravagantly gifted 33-year-old artist hails from Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second-largest city. She studied piano and voice there, earning recognition with victories in many prestigious competitions. While still a student, she was immersed in a French-speaking environment: Geneva's Conservatoire de Musique, where she completed her vocal training. It was in France that her technique and stylistic flair acquired the final polish required for a young artist exhibiting major career potential. This occurred initially with the prestigious Le Jardin des Voix led by William Christie, with whom she also toured internationally in a variety of Baroque works. The next major milestone in her development was a summer spent at the music academy of Aix-en-Provence, where she earned the Special Prize of Les Amis du Festival as Fiordiligi in Cos\u00ec fan tutte.\nIt was inevitable that such a promising artist would be welcomed by Paris's major performance venues. Having captured first prize in the Operalia competition (held at Milan's La Scala), the following year Sonya starred first as Handel's Cleopatra at Versailles and then as Bizet's Le\u00efla at the Op\u00e9ra Comique. She also established herself as a favorite in the city's most important concert halls. Those previous achievements, however, were eclipsed by the absolute sensation she created in Lucia di Lammermoor, her debut at the Bastille. The city of Paris acknowledged her artistry in a very special way when it acclaimed her in the Concert de Paris, presented last year in front of the Eiffel Tower\u2013an engagement she will repeat in 2015.\nSonya Yoncheva, with orchestra conducted by Domingo Hindoyan, on 'Stars von Morgen with Rolando Villazon, November 16, 2014, performs Massenet's Herodiade, Act 1,Scene 1: 'Celui don't la parole,' also featured on her debut album, Paris, mon amour\nSonya Yoncheva's connection to French opera, and to Paris, has led to a debut album concentrating on a particularly appealing period, the \"Belle Epoque.\" Those years\u2013-1871 to 1914\u2013were notable for sophistication, incomparable romance, boundless imagination and a certain boldness in all areas of cultural life. The Belle Epoque eminently suits Sonya, who communicates both elegance and panache onstage, both in her distinctive, multicolored voice and her irresistible personality. Among the album's highlights are arias by Jacques Offenbach and Jules Massenet, who knew how to create rewarding, crowd-pleasing works for Parisians of their era. Their music gives Sonya a wonderful opportunity to display her versatility as a vocal actress in excerpts from Les contes d'Hoffmann, H\u00e9rodiade, Le Cid, and Tha\u00efs. Her ease in the middle range enables her to excel in the final aria sung by the heroine of Charles Gounod's Sapho, originally written for mezzo-soprano. Sonya's musical curiosity will leave devotees of French opera in her debt, thanks to her resurrection of numbers from unjustly neglected works by Charles Lecocq and Andr\u00e9 Messager.\nFrom Paris, mon amour, Sonya Yoncheva performs from La Boh\u00e8me, Act III: 'Donde lieta usci'\nYoncheva complements the French composers with the two best-known Italian operatic creators of the Belle Epoque years, each of whom had his share of memorable experiences in Paris. Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata, of course, takes place in that very city, and Violetta is the quintessential parisienne, despite the conflicted feelings about her life that emerge in her great Act One solo scene. As for Giacomo Puccini, he composed his first opera, Le villi and his fourth, La boh\u00e8me, within a period that found the Belle Epoque in full swing.

From a \"High Church\" liturgy of bells and incense to the chants and prayers of pilgrims, the voice releases the pain and pleasure of the human spirit and questions God, life, and faith. From praise to curse, we've captured the resonance of the times through music.\n\n\"Amazing Grace,\" \"Nobody Knows the Trouble I've Seen,\" and \"I Believe\" all express the angst of hope, trial, and faith. As we listen to music, we can feel renewal, refreshment, and that inner release of pain or love that can move us ever so slightly from blues to bliss.\n\nThis book is about the sounds of spirit that help us deepen our faith. From ancient chants to folk songs and dance, the power of music instantly connects us with the past, present, and future. We can feel empathy toward slaves and prisoners and be inspired to bring harmony to those around us. We can tap into the great pool of inspiration that has touched mystics and musicians throughout the ages by listening to the remarkable recordings made available over the past few decades. We can dance with the African shamans, the Haitian Christians, and the Native Americans. Our hearts are intrigued with the chanting monks from Tibet, calmed by the Benedictine sisters, and ever inspired by the gospel songs of Mahalia Jackson.\n\nIn this book of short essays, the nature of sound and spirit will be explored through song, rhythm, melody, and mood, with the simple goal of reminding us how easy it is to let music be an instrument of faith. These sounds are here to keep us human, remind us of the heavens, and sometimes transport us there. Simple hymns or chants can improve our prayer life; deep listening can reward us with unfettered consciousness, which isn't weighed down by mental materialism. As we look for balance, harmony, and peace in the world, music is an ever-available tool that can transport us to a better place. Whether you're agnostic, Christian, Jewish, Muslim, Hindu, or atheist, the negative will hold you back from living your potential.\n\n\"Vibration is the center of all life. We are most alive when we sing together with a magnetic fire,\" says Alice Parker, composer and conductor. To bring our harmonious spirit into action\u2014alone, together, and with our prayer-filled intentions\u2014we can sound our spirits. I believe that when we transcend the verbal debates of politics, religion, and belief, we can find \"active harmony\" in this world.\n\nYour spirit is ever alive and awake to inspire you, so let it dance and rejoice, and allow it to be a better listener. Release the left-brain consciousness, and let music in every corner of your mind begin to sing.\n\n\u2014 Don Campbell  \nBoulder, Colorado\n\n_We are our grandmothers' prayers.  \nAnd we are our grandfathers' dreamings.  \nWe are the breath of our ancestors.  \nWe are the Spirit of God._\n\n\u2014 YSAYE BARNWELL\n\nCHAPTER ONE\n\nCreating a  \nSOUND SPIRIT\n\nIt's timely that I begin to write more intimately about my relationship with music since my baby-boomer curiosity and exploration of faith have now become primary in the way I approach sound. So much of my professional life has been based on bringing music's healthy powers to our world. My books on music, health, education, and acoustics have always been supported by my own strong faith, which is grounded in sound. Having a family who sang around the piano was my foundation; and I was taken to a church that worshipped through the essentials of great congregational singing, choral masterpieces, and wonderful organ music. The transformation that took place every time I was \"inside music\" as a child is still the basic inspiration for my work and daily life.\n\nNow, after traveling and studying in 45 countries and living for extended periods in Asia and Europe, I sense that the thread connecting sound to spirit is beyond art and entertainment. Music's power can be raw, startling, and empowering. It need not be just calm and complacent to soothe us; it can dig much deeper to our soul's source of faith and inspiration"</details> | 1024 | Book | 61911 | 2.9890622875 | 0.2492800447 | 1.7440406386 | 0.2254038329 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

Even red\u2014encoded in the film's title, and translatable as the color of passion and dementia\u2014is played down, held back from dramatic emphasis until the climax. Instead, we have a variety of tonal possibilities. Certainly, vibrant, bold colors are present\u2014and admired, I would say\u2014as part of modern industrial/consumerist society: the bright, undifferentiated yellows, oranges, and blues of children's toys, of plastic containers, and of factory furnishings, similar in their way to the hues of contemporary American color-field artists like Frank Stella and Barnett Newman (maybe, too, there is a touch of Rothko in the rectangular splotches of unfinished paintwork that decorate the bare walls of Giuliana's gallery). But there are also the much more muted palettes associated with the flaking doors and decayed woodwork of the quayside hut in which the party of Giuliana and her husband's friends hole up during one of the film's central sequences, and the misty browns and greens of the estuary itself: soft, gentle, and, at the same time, luxurious halftones that seem to capture, or project, the sophisticated melancholy of the film's characters. And finally, in contrast to this again and in a superb, painterly touch, there are the serene blues, yellows, and whites of the interpolated child's story on the desert island, where the viewer finds himself, momentarily, in the presence of some abstract idea of color itself\u2014the color of heaven, as it were.\nIt is an astonishingly beautiful excursus from the main development of the narrative, while remaining, in retrospect, an integral part of it. Its mastery is discernible in its pace and overall spaciousness\u2014the sense that, within its boundaries, everything is given the right amount of time to develop, and that we can think about what it means while it is unraveling. What does it signify, finally? Plainly, the sexual undertones of the sequence are important, however much it is right to insist on the tale's complementary purity and simplicity. The episode gives us, perhaps, a poetic dramatization of the heroine's childhood psychology\u2014her curiosity combined with her fear of the world. Each of its three sections is utopian in some way\u2014yet also sinister and frightening. It gestures toward Giuliana's future loneliness and madness, identifying these things, paradoxically, with the last moment in her childhood of freedom and independence. None of this is said out loud to the viewer; rather, as is proper to art, it is invoked and painted and embodied.\nReturning to painting for a moment, then, it is interesting to make one more distinction. For if, traditionally, the older art form relies for its effect on monumentality and stillness (and the very special spiritual thoughtfulness that is released by such a calm), movies have a different and even opposite phenomenology: the thought that is proper to them arises, of course, from their implication in movement. Antonioni is one of the great masters of moving figurative compositions: the way his characters interact and change places with one another in the course of spoken dialogues is full of significance and tenderness. We hear what they say, but as they move around, we see what they think. In a way, of course, this is what the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne of cinema is always about; any director (together with his or her editor) needs to be accomplished in the basic grammatical rules: how actors sit and stand and change positions, how they walk in and out of frame, and so on. Antonioni excels at this skill using only two or three characters in a room or a landscape. But he displays an even greater virtuosity in the seamless choreography of groups\u2014as in the sequence mentioned earlier showing the party of friends in the hut. Here there are essentially two spaces: the body of the cabin itself, with stove and primitive seating area, and an \"inner sanctum,\" a sort of extended cupboard or cubbyhole, painted red, whither, one by one, the party of six eventually drifts, to end up lying on top of one another, in a kind of familial coz"</details> | 1024 | C4 | 34466 | 2.9561900772 | -0.2225505865 | 0.4987462951 | 0.9771998404 | F | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

From one brain state to another, the altered breath, along with spirit, opens our perceptions and sensations to both the hallowed and the haunted.\n\nThe Museum of Spirit and Music\n\nHow often do we visit a museum and discover a \"spirit being\" trapped in an \"art object\"? I think of myself as intuitive at times, although not particularly psychic. Yet on dozens of occasions, I've looked at a room of sacred objects such as icons, figures, sculptures, or carvings and seen vibrations, as if they were singing a tone or making sounds. Some museums display such forms by jamming them together like knickknacks in a crowded market stall, while others give them an honorable environment with plenty of air, space, and fine lighting.\n\nThere exists just such a special place to view and experience amazing sacred objects at a museum that opened in Paris in 2006, which holds some of the most unique collection of indigenous power beings on Earth. This institution awakens us to new ways to look, listen, and deepen our experiences with les objets spirituels. The Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly specializes in the master crafts and spirituality of African, Asian, American, and Oceanian art. Most of the pieces were created for religious or ceremonial purposes.\n\nThis place is unlike any other in the world. A widely traveled public with constant access to television and the Internet arrives at the doors with an intuitive and practical knowledge, as well as an appetite for more than bones and pottery. They want to know about the psycho-spiritual energy behind the creation of a ritual object.\n\nIn a way, the Mus\u00e9e du Quai Branly is theater. It moves us, dances with us, and enchants us into the living mythologies of world culture. As a large, 560-foot-long, abstract ship of a museum, it stands on massive columns in a growing arboretum. Thirty multicolored, boxlike rooms radiate out from the sides as viewers from within can glimpse the Eiffel Tower just a block away or the banks of the nearby Seine.\n\nFrom the amazing garden of 15,000 plants on the ground level, visitors begin to ascend a spiral ramp around a glass wall protecting hundreds of magical musical instruments from every corner of the globe. It's a singing tower of a sacred, shamanic Babel. The ramp leads into a leather-clad grand gallery, where more than 4,000 decorative or sacred art pieces are displayed as part of the 300,000-piece collection, which is divided into works from four distinct geographical areas.\n\nThe power of the museum lies in its display of fascinating invocations, songs, and dances. Each of the little box rooms protrudes from the museum; some have four walls of ritualistic cinema, while others contain fine ethnographic and decorative art. After a half-hour of meandering through the dimly lit open hall, the power of these ritual objects begins to take hold of the viewer's unconscious and intuitive reactions to the visual and auditory powers of spirit and art.\n\nAlong many of the leather walls are ledges where we can sit in front of small video screens that show sacred rites, complete with narration in English, German, Japanese, or Spanish. We can touch the screen and navigate to footage of a birthing ceremony or a funeral, hear crop songs, or witness the weddings or coming-of-age rituals from a village near where the sacred objects were found. The Sound Spirit is evident everywhere, yet it never overpowers the space\u2014except in some of the small, boxed rooms that extend from the main gallery and feature art, music, or special videos of sacred rites. Never has there been such a worldwide representation of spirit and ritual that can be viewed through a keyhole with our own sense of timing, understanding, and reverence.\n\nThroughout the museum, dozens of languages are sounding. Prayers, drums, chants, and rituals are all alive with style. We aren't intruding, except in the sense that these grand objets rituels have been taken from their home people. Still, these objects are honored here, and with the ears of our hearts, we can feel their beauty and inspiration.\n\nSpirit Music**\n\nFrom the chants"</details> | 1024 | Book | 61911 | 2.9561900772 | 2.0284933688 | 1.6730258898 | 0.9459833972 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

They will once again be striving to reach the NBA finals and hoist the Larry O'Brien Trophy. The 76ers had another disappointing end to their season last year after losing in the Conference Semifinals against the Miami Heat in six games. After making numerous moves this offseason, the roster is too talented to not make it further this season. Will Joel Embiid and the Sixers be able to get over the hump this year?\nThird-year veteran Tyrese Maxey will be labeled the starting point guard with James Harden also taking ball-handling responsibilities. Maxey truly made a name for himself last season averaging 17.5 points, 4.3 assists, and shooting 42.7% from beyond the arc. Maxey will be a viable factor in the Sixers' success this season once again. The backup point guard duties will go to Shake Milton and the newly acquired De'Anthony Melton from the Memphis Grizzlies. Both are exceptional scoring guards and will provide help in the rotation.\nShooting Guard\nSix-time All-NBA First Team James Harden will start at the shooting guard position. This will be Harden's first full season in Philadelphia after being traded from the Brooklyn Nets. Last season the former MVP dealt with a hamstring injury throughout the year and truly never looked like his regular self. He needs to get back into his scoring mindset as he had in Houston when he was playing the best basketball of his career. He will need to prove that he did not take a step back and still is the same James Harden that once had NINE 50-point games in one season. Harden averaged 22 points, 7.7 rebounds, and 10.3 assists last season. Furkan Korkmaz will back up Harden in his sixth NBA season. He provides three-point shooting off the bench and is a career 35.5% shooter from three.\nTobias Harris will be entering his fifth season as a 76er. There was a time many fans wanted Harris to be traded for some younger pieces, but it seems like he is staying in Philadelphia for the time being. Harris averaged 17.2 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 3.5 assists last season. He will be a valuable piece to the Sixers' success this season. Mattisse Thybulle will also be coming off the bench. Thybulle is known for his excellent defense but truly struggles on the offensive end. He needs to become a better shooter so he can get more minutes and contribute more. In this day in age in the NBA, it's difficult to put a player on the court that lacks scoring and shooting ability, the game has evolved immensely.\nNewly acquired veteran P.J. Tucker will start at the power forward position. This was the Sixers' best off-season move. Tucker provides excellent defense and exceptional corner three-point shooting. As he is getting older his minutes may decrease, but Tucker will improve this team overall, especially from a leadership standpoint. He averaged 7.6 points, 5.5 rebounds, and shot 41.5% from three last season with the Miami Heat. Georges Niang and off-season signee Daniel House Jr. will contribute at power forward also.\nThe 2022-23 MVP favorite Joel Embiid goes into his seventh season as Philadelphia's starting center. Embiid has shown he is the man in Philly and can lead them all the way. He averaged 30.6 points, 11.7 rebounds, and 4.2 assists last season. He truly is an unstoppable force at center when healthy. However, he cannot do everything himself, he needs help. They have built around Embiid and added a lot of pieces that could get them over the hump. I have no doubt Embiid will come out this season and be as dominant as ever. This season newly acquired Montrezl Harrell will come off the bench for Embiid. The former 6th Man of the Year averaged 13.1 points and 6.1 rebounds last season in Charlotte. The center position will be the most talented position on the Six"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 37870 | 0.0606962203 | 0.2441319875 | -0.1803322395 | -0.6964567559 | F | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

While it is not news that the group is slightly more centrist than anti-Israel groups like Jewish Voice for Peace and IfNotNow, it is interesting to see how the group is relishing defeating moderate Democrats, much like the left-wing anti-Zionist extremists from the Democratic Socialists of America.\nOn June 29, J Street posted about its elation that its alt-left candidate for Congress in Illinois defeated the primary challenger favored by the centrist group Democratic Majority for Israel (DMFI). J Street led its press release with \"Following principled progressive Delia Ramirez's landslide victory over DMFI-endorsed Gilbert Villegas in the Democratic primary for Illinois' 3rd congressional district,\u2026\" The group just could have led that it's happy its preferred candidate won, but it opted to focus on the defeat of DMFI's preferred candidate.\nJ Street said that its PAC spent $140,000 on supporting the Working Families' Party candidate, to combat funds from \"the AIPAC-aligned Democratic Majority For Israel (DMFI) and other right-leaning groups.\" Note that AIPAC and DMFI are not \"right-leaning groups\" but centrist; it's J Street that's far-left, making those groups appear right-leaning from their perspective.\nJ Street then doubled down on mischaracterizing the centrist pro-Israel groups stating \"In an election cycle that has seen the ultra-hawkish right-wing group AIPAC and its allies like DMFI\u2026 (emphasis is J Street's)\" These are inflammatory and blatantly untrue statements that DMFI \u2013 a purely Democratic group! \u2013 is \"ultra-hawkish\" and \"right-wing.\"\nJ Street is completely untethered from reality.\nJ Street is continuing on its far-left, Arab-centered mission on June 30th.\nJeremy Ben Ami, the president of J Street, is going to speak with Jim Zogby of the Arab American Institute. Their topic is rebuking the United States for the alleged crimes of the Jewish State. It will continue Zogby's assertion that \"Sanctions [against Israel] and accountability become absolutely essential to this discussion.

This project starts NOW, so please contact me if you want to participate.\n\n## Motivation\n\nI have seen many apps that enable voting or store data for polls, but I have not found one that does exactly what I want.  If you know of an app that fits the description of this app, please let me know :smile: .\n\nOne principle I feel is important is that voters should be encouraged to vote for what they think is best, without fearing that their vote will be lost if they vote for something that does not win.  If you take a chance and vote for an outsider, your vote should still count for or against the lead candidates.\n\n## Example: Choose a project name\n\nWhen starting a project, it can be good to actually name it to give the participants a sense of what the purpose of the project is.  All participants should have the right to propose suggestions for the project name, but when there are too many suggestions, it becomes very hard to find the best one.\n\nA plain discussion can work, but strong personalities will influence the choices of others even if their suggestions are not the best.  The solution to this is a secret vote, so participants can vote on the suggestion they like the best without fear of offending the others.\n\nHere are some ways to do it.\n\n### One suggestion per participant, one vote per participant.\n\nMost often, participants will like their own suggestions best, so if each participant only gets to submit one suggestion, and only gets one vote, the result is likely to be that each suggestion gets only one vote (from the one who submited it).  One way to try to work around this is to deny votes on suggestions you have submitted yourself, but then the result may be wrong if you actually change your mind and don't like (all of) your own suggestions after you submitted them.\n\n### One suggestion per participant, multiple votes per participant.\n\nOne way to avoid the one vote per suggestion is to give multiple votes per participant.  People could still put all their votes on their own suggestion, but that can be avoided by only allowing one vote per person on each suggestion.  This should lead to the most liked suggesitons getting the most votes, but it limits the creativity of the participants.  Typically some participants will have no suggestion or maybe one while other participants will have many excellent suggestions.  This creativity should be welcomed, not suppressed.\n\n### Multiple suggestions per participant, multiple votes per participant.\n\nSo, enabling creativity by allowing any number of suggestions and giving multiple votes sounds good, right?  But to make things practical, you have to limit the nuber of votes, and when the creativity is high, you get many suggestions, and the votes get thinned out so it is likely that they are spread out and suggestions will have few votes and the result becomes pretty random because you can win by having one more vote than the second best choice.  Also there will be less consensus since there will be MANY more votes for OTHER choices than the winning one, just not on the same contender.\n\n### What about disliked suggestions?\n\nIn addition to finding a suggestion that is popular, voting should try to pick up if a suggestion is UNPOPULAR.  I would like the voting system to reflect that \"I like THIS suggestion best, but I like ANY suggestion better than THAT!\".  I would also like the system to make the voting group have as strong consensus as possible.\n\n### Like the presidentional voting in France?\n\nPlease correct me if I am wrong here.  I want to learn :smile: .\n\nWhen voting for a president in France, there are lots of candidates, and voting starts by everyone voting for their favorite.  After the first round, unless there is a 50%+ majority for any candidate, the candidate(s) with the least votes are removed from the contest, and there is a new round of voting where everyone gets to vote for their favorite of the remaining candidates.  If there is as 50%+ majority, a winner is announced, else the candidate(s) with the least votes is again removed from the contest, and there is a new round of voting.\n\nThis repeats until a candidate gets over 50% of the votes, often the last vote has only two candidates.  That means that EVERYONE gets to vote for or against the actual candidate that wins (or abstain from voting).  This gives a nice warm feeling that YOUR vote counts.\n\n### Any number of suggestions per participant, priority voting\n\nHere"</details> | 1024 | Github | 47030 | 0.0606962203 | -0.6153697315 | 0.9222985463 | -0.6372755823 | E | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

What does it mean?\nComing at a time when state and federal officials are still working to overcome challenges to the information technology systems necessary to make the exchanges work, some experts say that even a small delay could jeopardize the start of the six-month open enrollment period.\nU.S. officials have said repeatedly that the marketplaces, which are the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's signature healthcare reform law, would begin on time.\nBut the October 1 deadline has already begun to falter at the state level, with Oregon announcing plans to scale back the launch of its own marketplace and California saying it would consider a similar move.\nI'm betting January 1 is already dead in the water. But don't worry:\nBut having everything ready on October 1 is not a critical issue.\nWell, what IS the critical issue:\nWhat matters to people is January 1, which is when the coverage is supposed to start.

When the time comes for the use of force, I'm very alright with using that force and then walking away \u2013 the walking away part is the hard part. But here in Syria, we have such a different set of circumstances.\nFirst, there are no \"good guys\" in the fight. To be sure, there are innocent civilians being impacted in horrible horrible ways, but the aggressive actors are all rotten \u2013 we have no natural ally in the field. Given this, by attacking Syria, we are, by definition, helping Al Qaeda.\nFrankly, when asked who we would root for in a war between Syria and Al Qaeda, the only sane answer is \"Casualties\".\nSecond, if a state uses chemical weapons, the line has been crossed and distinct action must take place. The world is no place for nation states, complete with well functioning chains of command, to be using chemical weapons. Against an enemy or against its own citizenry.\nGood guy or bad guy \u2013 that cannot go unpunished.\nWhich brings me to my third point. There is no rational reason for the Assad regime to carry out a chemical attack against his own people. Those that hate him, already do. And those that support him, again, already do. There is nothing to gain by the mass murder of that many innocent people.\nAssad surly must know that America would strike. That we would take action and react to that red line. And that if he was faced with using chemical weapons, it must be in a case that NOT using them was worse than the repercussions OF using them.\nAnd I don't see a compelling argument that Assad took any advantage by the use of that chemical strike.\nI'm sure that a crime against humanity has been committed. And I'm sure that someone must be held accountable for this crime. I just don't think that America should act as the world's police force and rush to judgement -and sentencing- of this particular crime.\nLet the UN handle it.\nAnd you know what?

It gets stuck in my head so often, and I love more every time. Go Florence!\nLouder than sirens. Louder than bells. Sweeter than heaven and hotter than HELL! How can you beat those intense lyrics?!\nWHAT?! How can anything top... Louder than sirens louder than bells sweeter than heaven and hotter than HELL\n#1 by far...I'm mostly hip hop fan but this is one of the best songs of all time, let alone the best Florence song\n21 All This and Heaven Too\nA nice and charming touch! A definite feel-good song by Florence Welch! I saw this song on this list and I had never heard it before, but now that I have, I absolutely love it! Highly recommend it to Florence listeners out there!\nI first fell in love with it when I heard Florence sing it live at the Royal Albert Hall. There's just something really sweet and soft about this song. If there's one thing keeping me going, it's this song.\nOne of my favorite songs on the album! It's got a really beautiful, magical feel to it that never ceases to make me feel all gooey inside. Everything about it is amazing.\nIt has such a magical feeling when the chorus finally starts... It's so transcendent.\n22 Delilah\nThis song is really beautiful! Definitely in my top three. (Just under cosmic love)\nThis is the best song that has ever happened to me.\nIts good, but I find it a bit long & repetitive\nI prefer the drake version\n23 Pure Feeling\nUnderrated because it's a bonus track! Such a powerful song.\n24 Swimming\nBecause this did not appear on either album, I've never really felt the incentive to lists to it, but once I did I found it awe-inspiring. The lyrics have such meaning and emotion so that you form an emotions connection. Also, the instrumental is another great aspect-for example the violins playing in the first 10 seconds is a definite highlight and just really solidifies how amazing this song really is. If you haven't already heard this, I highly recommend doing so, you absolutely won't regret it!\nI have listened to every single song Florence + the Machine has produced and I will confidently say that this is my absolute favorite. Nothing compares. Really! Nothing! This song is so amazing...that being said, I was well into my Florence obsession before I ever listened to it, as it is on"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 51802 | 0.0606962203 | -1.2197068777 | -1.4364056073 | -1.8504896412 | F | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 5 | 4 |

| <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>"a champion level of 13+ wins a tournament. Oh, and by the way: you have to start not reaching that level, but in consecutive basho.\nI said in the recent Tachiai podcast that Asanoyama's debut basho as an Ozeki was a success. It was, especially in light of other recent Ozeki performances, and I don't think any of the above commentary detracts from that. The problem is, the inability of those behind him in the banzuke to deliver has meant we now hope for more from the new top Ozeki.\nBehind him, there are promising scenes, but also much of a muchness. Any one of Shodai, Mitakeumi, Daieisho, or even Endo, Hokutofuji and Terunofuji of the immediate challengers can put enough together to mount a run to become the new Ozeki. But none of them have displayed either the consistency, health, mental toughness, or technique (or in some cases all four) required to become serious Yokozuna candidates. We're still waiting to see what the generation behind them is really made of at the top level: the Kotoshohos, the Kotonowakas, the Hoshoryus. It will be some time until we can develop real expectations there.\nAnd the problem is, while we all love an underdog story, every Maegashira 17 yusho means we look even further down the line for the next great champion. These are great moments, heroic moments, great for the sport, the rikishi, the supporters and the stables. The flip side is that each of these moments trashes a rope run, an Ozeki run, a chance for someone of great expectation to make their next step.\nThe expectation is that in seven days' time we are going to see a basho with no Yokozuna grand champion, no dohyo-iri, no great pageantry, no storied legend who electrifies the room the moment they walk down the hanamichi. Don't think for a minute that Asanoyama, Shodai, and Mitakeumi don't know that this is their moment, that no matter how many times we say \"they may never get a better chance,\" they really may never get a better chance.\nBut now it's time to deliver it. Close doesn't count.\n\u2190 Tachiai Aki (video) Podcast\nPodcast Bumper Music Refresh \u2192\n25 thoughts on \"A Surplus of Almost\"\nSteven X says:\nI fear Asanoyama has that awful position of the next one. if he beats Hakuho in a basho \"well it's only because Hakuho was old and broken down\". If he gets to Yokozuna but Hakuho's absent \"well he never really beat Hakuho when it mattered\". And even if he has reasonable amounts of success \"yes well Hakuho had 44 wins, Asanoyama's not that good really\".\nThe next one is a cursed place.I personally think he will be the next Yokozuna, but I expect to hear people made these yes but's about him for the next 10 years.\nYeah, I take your point. It's unfair to compare anyone except the very best all time greats to Hakuho. In fairness, I don't think anyone looks at the achievements of Harumafuji and Kakuryu (or to a lesser extent Kisenosato), who became Yokozuna after Hakuho and during his reign, in a lesser light because of that. If anything it's possible to make the argument that they might compare favourably to Chiyonofuji's supporting cast and the end of his career (a group that's also full of some of the more prestigious names atop today's Kyokai).\nLikewise, someone like Akebono is never going to be compared to Chiyonofuji, even though he was on his way up the division when Chiyonofuji grabbed his final yusho. I think it will just be a different era post-Hakuho, and the hope is that like that, if it's Asanoyama, he and whoever comes up with him are able to define the new post-Hakuho era the way that those defined it after all timers like Taiho and Chiyonofuji.\nTimoth\u00e9e Heinz says:\nI like this article very much!

Gary finally managed to loosen up after a few drinks, and he struck up a conversation with a girl from Quantum Robotics. He found her fascinating, and by some miracle, she seemed to feel the same way about him. Any previous anxieties he'd had about this evening were quickly dissipated.\nRupert, on the other hand, wasn't having all that much fun. Being a robot, he couldn't drink, and his lack of a face-plate made it impossible to find a dance partner. He was also losing his patience with the people who saw him as a source of amusement. As Andy had predicted, everyone at the party got a real kick out of his non-robot-like disposition \u2014 everyone, that was, except for Rupert. He was getting pissed off.\nAs if things weren't bad enough, Roche had returned. He saw the crowd forming around Rupert, and he had to be a part of it. No, he had to be the leader of it.\n\"I see you found my big metal friend,\" he said, reaching up and slapping his arms around Rupert's shoulders. \"Isn't he cuuute?\" he crooned as he tweaked what was left of Rupert's cheek without his face-plate. This started everyone laughing.\nRupert now had about all the affronts to his dignity he could stand that evening. \"Get your $%$^%$ hands off me!\"\n\"Now, now. Is that any way for a good little robot to talk? We might have to wash your voice synthesizer out with soap.\"\n\"I'm warning you\u2026\"\n\"Temper, temper. You might blow a fuse.\" Everyone laughed again, partly because it was amusing, and partly because Roche was a man to be patronized.\n\"You fat, bald piece of $#&! Get your sweaty, worthless hands off me before I rip them off and shove them up your @$$! No one here likes you! They're all just putting up with you because of your title! But you already knew that! Deep down, we all know what a worthless piece of $%&@ you really are.\"\nSome stood with their jaws hanging in shock. Some were brave enough to clap. But all were ecstatic. They had all themselves dreamed of saying very similar things to Roche, who stood sputtering with outrage.\n\"How dare you,\" Roche said, seething with rage and suddenly seeming very sober. \"I think it's time you were turned off. He began to reach for the back of Rupert's neck.\nBig mistake. Rupert backhanded him so fast that he was sent flying right through the large picture window behind the group.\nThe entire warehouse suddenly grew very quiet. Even the music stopped playing. Both Gary and Andy could only stand still with their mouths hanging open as they watched their careers go flying out the window after Roche.\nEvery eye in the room was suddenly on Rupert. \"What?\" he shouted. \"Do any of you wanna go after him?\"\nThis entry was posted in Earth-1 on June 25, 2002 by 5earths.\nAbout the Five Earths Project\nThe Five Earths Project is the go-to site for Golden Age, Silver Age, and Pre-Crisis DC Comics fan fiction!

Given the posterior parameter samples and the current wind speed forecast, we then obtain samples from the posterior predictive distribution for the wind power production by sampling a value from the likelihood model in \\eqref{eq:wind likelihood} for each posterior parameter sample and transforming these to wind power. \n\n\\subsection{Two-stage copula model} \n\nAn alternative model construction is a two-stage Gaussian copula model which builds on the work of \\cite{DobraLenkoski2011} and \\cite{Moeller&2013}.  In the first stage, we perform joint estimation of the marginal predictive distributions following the set up above with $G$ equal to the independence graph.  If $G_0$ is equal to the independence graph, the marginal predictive distributions are estimated independently, while an AR(1) structure in the graph $G_0$ imposes an autogressive structure on each of $\\boldsymbol \\beta_i$ for $i = 0, 1,2$.  We consider both of these options. \n\nTo estimate the error correlation, we proceed as follows. The estimation of the marginal predictive distributions yields forcast-observation pairs $\\{ F_{tn}, y_{tn}\\}$ for $n = 1,\\ldots,N$ and $t = 1,\\ldots,T$, where $F$ denotes the predictive distribution. We may then infer $N$ latent Gaussian observations $\\{ \\mathbf z_{n} \\}{n=1}^N$ by setting $z{tn} = \\Phi^{-1}(F_{tn}(y_{tn}))$, where we denote the standard Gaussian cumulative distribution function by $\\Phi$.

For instance, a star pattern'' is a star pattern'' no matter how much bright or pale it is. Therefore, the advantage of simplicial learning over dictionary learning is expected to diminish in some real-world applications. This is observable in digit classification experiments featuring USPS~\\cite{USPS} and MNIST datasets as reported in Table~\\ref{last_class}. In this set of experiments, ESL is compared to classification methods including Supervised Dictionary Learning~\\cite{mairal2009supervised} with generative training (SDL-G) and with discriminative learning (SDL-D), Task-driven Dictionary Learning~\\cite{mairal2011task}: unsupervised (TDDL-G) and supervised (TDDL-D), FDDL, KNN, Gaussian SVM, Locality-constrained Linear Coding (LLC)~\\cite{wang2010locality} and Locality-sensitive Dictionary Learning (LDL)~\\cite{wei2013locality}. LLC and LDL methods have the sum-to-one constraint on sparse codes, therefore they learn spaces with arbitrary offsets but learned models are still not bounded (without the non-negativity constraint).\n\nAs apparent from Table~\\ref{last_class}, ESL appears to be a successful generative-only method which performs nearly at the capacity of Gaussian SVM (i.e., a well-known and widely used discriminative classifier). However, it cannot outperform discriminative dictionary learning methods such as FDDL and TDDL-D in these datasets. A final note is that ESL can also be modified through discriminative elements. Discriminative methods SDL-D and TDDL-D have a $1.5-2\\%$ advantage over their generative counterparts SDL-G and TDDL-G. Hence, a successful discriminative version of ESL can then be projected to reach state-of-the-art, an estimation open to discussion or further investigation.\n\n\n\n\\section{Discussion and Conclusion}\n\\label{sec:Conc}\n\nDictionary learning through simplicials is more flexible than classical dictionary learning models since simplices are bounded and freely positioned in space. The proposed sparsity based evolutionary structure, called ESL is highly applicable if the characteristics of the problem at hand requires such successful localized models. In this study, a global fitness function is employed and there is no restriction on the local fitness of each individual simplex within the simplicial. If the local fitness of each simplex is considered and optimized individually, the resulting simplicial model might be in a more compact form. For example, the unnecessary simplex of green simplicial in Fig.~\\ref{fig:syn_Res}(c) would most probably be eliminated as it does not have any"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 42619 | 0.0605250109 | -0.0083466425 | 0.7396891925 | 1.6015287048 | E | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

In addition to oracle bones, the Shang also produced large numbers of bronze vessels of remarkable artistic quality that were used in sacrifices to the dead.\n\nBronze technology marks the birth of Chinese civilization. An alloy of copper and tin with a small amount of lead, bronze requires first the location, mining, and refining of the appropriate metal ores, followed by the smelting of the three metals in exact proportions at very high temperatures (over 1,000 degrees Centigrade). In contrast to the Mesopotamians, who produced small quantities of forged or hammered bronze perhaps five centuries before China, Shang bronze makers mined abundant deposits of copper and tin ores to cast molten bronze in huge quantities and in highly sophisticated designs.\n\nBronze technology was a hallmark of both the Shang and (its successor) the Zhou societies, and some vessels were inscribed with information about their sacrificial purposes. The technology involved a complex sequence of carving a negative model of the outside of the vessel, putting it, in several pieces, around a clay core (which outlined the inner surface of the vessel), and then pouring hot molten bronze between the inner core and the outer piece molds. Once the molten bronze cooled, the piece molds were removed, and the result was a bright, luminous vessel that was then smoothed and polished. Many items were made of bronze, including hair ornaments, weapons such as daggers and spears, and horse harness fittings, but the most common early bronze objects were sacrificial vessels (for wine and food) used to pay one's respects to the noble deceased ancestors of the Shang (and Zhou) kings, or to commemorate military victories or the appointment and installation of vassals and officials of the royal family.\n\nThe most lavish tomb findings from Anyang to date are from the tomb of Lady Hao (Fu Hao), one of sixty-four consorts (or wives) of the Shang king Wu Ding (reign ca. 1215\u20131190 BCE). Whereas most other Shang tombs were at least partially looted long before the twentieth century, Lady Hao's tomb, though smaller than many, was discovered completely intact in 1976, yielding 3 ivory carvings, 468 bronzes (weighing about 3,500 pounds and requiring 11 tons of ore to produce), 500 bone hairpins, 590 jade objects (from sources far beyond Shang control), and nearly 7,000 cowry shells (from the sea coast), which were used as money. From oracle bone and bronze inscriptions, we know that Lady Hao was King Wu Ding's favorite consort and that she led Shang troops into battle and performed oracle bone divinations herself.\n\n_This bronze zun, or ritual wine vessel, in the shape of two rams is from the thirteenth or twelfth century BCE. Such cast bronze vessels, used by royal families primarily in sacrifices to ancestral spirits, required the large-scale mining of copper, tin, and lead, smelting the ores at 1000 degrees centigrade, and the design of complex negative molds in clay.*The Trustees of The British Museum, British Museum, London, Great Britain / Art Resource, NY\n\n_This Shang oracle bone inscription explains that the diviner asked if Lady Hao's childbearing would be good if it came on a certain day. The result, also recorded on the bone, was that her childbearing, in the end, \"was not good,\" as she gave birth to a girl.* From the collections of the Institute of History and Philology at the Academia Sinica, Republic of China\n\nShang bronzes and oracle bones reveal the Shang as a very hierarchical society in which some were slaves and servants at the bottom, many were illiterate farmers, menial laborers and craftsmen, and a few were privileged aristocrats who lived and died amid great wealth and splendor. The elite in this society paid careful attention to the care of dead ancestors, on the assumption that kings who were powerful in life were even more powerful in death. Thus, survivors filled the graves with bronze sacrificial vessels, and kings were accompanied in death by their servants, slaves, mistresses, and animals such as pigs and dogs"</details> | 1024 | Book | 28901 | 1.7180034894 | 3.5469464057 | 1.9773748129 | 1.5182848562 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

Hence, private companies can perform work, under diplomatic cover, for the US government without being under the direct control of the host state - in this case the Republic of Georgia. This practice is often used by the CIA to provide cover for its agents.\nDTRA contractors\nThree private American companies work at the US bio-laboratory in Tbilisi - CH2M Hill, Battelle and Metabiota. In addition to the Pentagon, these private contractors perform biological research for the CIA and various other government agencies.\nCH2M Hill has been awarded $341.5 million DTRA contracts under the Pentagon's program for bio-laboratories in Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan, South East Asia. Half of this sum ($161.1 million) is allocated to the Lugar Center under the Georgian contract.\nAccording to CH2M Hill, the US Company has secured biological agents and employed former bio-warfare scientists at the Lugar Center. These are scientists who are working for another American company involved in the military program in Georgia - Battelle Memorial Institute.\nAs a $59 million subcontractor at the Lugar Center, Battelle has extensive experience in research on bio-agents, as the company has already worked on the US Bio-weapons Program under 11 previous contracts with the US Army (1952-1966).\nSource: US Army Activities in the US, Biological Warfare Programs, vol. II, 1977, p. 82\nThe private company performs work for the Pentagon's DTRA bio laboratories in Afghanistan, Armenia, Georgia, Uganda, Tanzania, Iraq, Afghanistan and Vietnam. Battelle conducts research, development, testing, and evaluation using both highly toxic chemicals and highly pathogenic biological agents for a wide range of US government agencies. It has been awarded some $2 billion federal contracts in total, and ranks 23 on the Top 100 US government contractors list.\nThe CIA-Battelle Project Clear Vision\nProject Clear Vision (1997 and 2000), a joint investigation by the CIA and the Battelle Memorial Institute, under a contract awarded by the Agency, reconstructed and tested a Soviet-era anthrax bomblet in order to test its dissemination characteristics. The project's stated goal was to assess bio-agents dissemination characteristics of bomblets. The clandestine CIA-Battelle operation was omitted from the US Biological Weapons Convention declarations submitted to the UN.\nAnthrax spores under microscope\nTop Secret Experiments\nBattelle has operated a Top Secret Bio laboratory (National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center - NBACC) at Fort Detrick, Maryland, under a US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) contract for the last decade. The company has been awarded a $344.4 million federal contract (2006 - 2016) and another $17.3 million contract (2015 -2026) by DHS.\nNBACC\n\u00a9 DHS\nNBACC is classified as a US Top Secret facility.\nAmong the secret experiments performed by Battelle at NBACC, are: Assessment of powder dissemination technology, Assessment of hazard posed by aerosolized toxins, and Assessment of virulence of B. Pseudomallei (Meliodosis) as a function of aerosol particle in non-human primates. Melioidosis has the potential to be developed as a biological weapon, hence it is classed as a category B.

She was also involved in extensive study of plankton from the coasts of Valentia Island.\n\nEarly life and education\n\nMaude Delap was born in Templecrone Rectory, County Donegal, the seventh child of ten of Rev Alexander Delap and Anna Jane (n\u00e9e Goslett). In 1874, when Maude was aged 8, the family moved to Valentia Island when her father became the rector of the island and Cahirciveen. Maude and her sisters received very little formal education in contrast to their brothers, though they benefited from some progressive primary school teaching. Maude and her sister Constance were encouraged in their interest in zoology and biology from their father, who himself published notes in the Irish Naturalist and elsewhere.\n\nCollecting and research\n\nMaude, and her sister Constance, were prolific collectors of marine specimens many of which are now housed within the collections of the Natural History Museum, Dublin. Based on their work a survey was undertaken by the Royal Irish Academy headed by Edward T. Browne of University College London in 1895 and 1896, a precursor to the Clare Island Survey. Following this collaboration Maude and Constance continued to collect specimens through dredging and tow-netting as well as recording sea temperature and changes in marine life. Maude kept in correspondence with Browne, sending specimens and drawings, until his death in 1937.\n\nDelap became increasingly interested in the life cycle of various species of jellyfish, being the first person to successfully breed them in captivity in her home laboratory using home made aquariums. She bred Chrysaora isosceles and Cyanea lamarckii in bell jars and published the results, observing their breeding and feeding habits. It was due to this pioneering work that the first identification of the various life cycle stages (medusa and hydra) belong to which species. Her laboratory was referred to as the department which her nephew, Peter Delap, described as an \"heroic jumble of books, specimens, aquaria, with its pervasive low-tide smell.\"\n\nDue to her contributions to marine biology she was offered a position in 1906 in the Plymouth Marine Biological Station, she declined due to her father's reaction, which reputedly was \"No daughter of mine will leave home, except as a married woman.\" Delap's interest continued in many forms of flora and fauna, which included the identification of a True's beaked whale which washed up on the island. This was a whale species that was previously only known from an incomplete specimen from the United States.\n\nLater life and recognition\nDelap had a sea anemone named in her honour, Edwardsia delapiae, which she first recorded in eelgrass on Valentia Island's shores. This anemone is found in shallow sea water and it is unknown outside Valentia Island. The naming had been suggested by Thomas Alan Stephenson in his book British sea anemones. Stephenson notes in his book that \"Miss Delap's skill and persistence in collecting rare species are indefatigable.\"\n\nIn 1936 Delap was made an associate of the Linnean Society of London. She died in July 1953, having been predeceased by all of her siblings, and was buried alongside her sisters near Knightstown, County Kerry.\n\nA plaque was erected to her in 1998 on Valentia Island by the Irish National Committee for Commemorative Plaques in Science and Technology. Maude was also the subject of an art work by Dorothy Cross, exploring her life and interaction with contemporary scientists and artists.\n\nPublications\n Browne, Edward Thomas and Delap, Maude Jane (1890) Notebooks, Drawings and Papers on Hydrozoa and Other Coelenterates from Valencia, Port Erin, Plymouth and Elsewhere\n Delap, Maude Jane (1899) Diary Recording Observations on Coelenterata and Other Marine Animals Around Valencia, Ireland\n\nReferences \n\n1866 births\n19"</details> | 1024 | Wikipedia | 47130 | 1.6960886826 | 3.332070976 | 2.1194043103 | 0.7352724055 | O | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

Equally important, he was able to encourage, accept, and learn from their criticisms. He pacified the border regions of the empire from Korea and Manchuria in the northeast and across the long northern borders from the Tarim Basin to the edge of Persia in Central Asia. He also pacified the southern borders from Annam (precursor of today's Vietnam) in the southeast to Tibet in the southwest. These military victories were solidified by strategic alliances that helped neutralize potential hostile forces. The Tang rulers managed to create the world's largest empire at that time. This was possible because the strong central government in the early Tang enjoyed a solid tax base and the increasingly prosperous Yangzi River valley was now tied closely through the Grand Canal to the capital in the north.\n\nDetermined to impose his strong will on the entire empire, Tang Taizong issued a comprehensive legal code in 653, which was revised and reissued every fifteen years. The Tang Code is the oldest surviving complete legal code from China. Following Qin and Han precedents, the Code specifies a series of general principles and, in five hundred articles, a remarkably detailed list of crimes with stipulated punishments. The Code was to be applied universally, but in deference to Confucian ideas about social hierarchies, punishments differed according to the social status and rank of the offender. Penalties ranged from ten strokes with a light stick or whip to one hundred blows from a heavy stick (which could be fatal), from a few years to a lifetime of penal servitude, and from exile to the borderlands to execution. In keeping with Confucian values, a father would not be punished for beating his son, but a son who struck his father would be in serious trouble. The Tang Code became the legal model for all subsequent dynasties from Tang times into the twentieth century.\n\nIn the early twentieth century, a dramatic archeological find gave scholars an intimate glimpse of the ways that Tang power extended to the remote corners of the empire. At Dunhuang (where the Silk Roads began), a sealed-up cave was discovered containing hundreds of documents surviving from their creation in Tang times. Many of the documents were Buddhist scriptures, but because paper was scarce, the scriptures were often copied on the backs of any paper the scribes could find, including contracts, loan agreements, bills of sale for slaves or land, notices of divorce, adoption or family division, and so on. In addition, the many government documents found at Dunhuang demonstrate how, even in that remote town, the Tang government regulated prices in local markets and kept meticulous track of land deeds, sales, and transfers in carrying out the equal-field system of land allotments to all commoners.\n\nThe Tang was the most cosmopolitan of all Chinese dynasties. The Li family founders (like the Yang family founders of the Sui) had long intermarried with the Xianbei and other nomadic tribes of the north and west. The peace and prosperity of the Tang, the foreign roots of its court, and the security its forces provided through Central Asia made the Tang a period of unprecedented international trade. The Silk Roads flourished in the Tang as never before or since, and so did a flourishing trade on the east coast with Arab merchant seamen from south and Southeast Asia. The Tang capital, Chang'an, was one of the world's great global crossroads.

That had forced several hundred people to undergo emergency medical treatment, and killed two postal workers. Iraq had declared 8,500 litres of anthrax, but UNSCOM estimated that Saddam Hussein could have produced 25,000 litres. If concentrated in dry form, that amount would be enough to fill tens of thousands of teaspoons, and Saddam Hussein had not verifiably accounted for even one teaspoon of that deadly material.\nContinuing, he said that one of the most worrisome things that emerged from the thick intelligence file the United States had on Iraq's biological weapons programme was mobile production facilities for biological agents. His country had first-hand descriptions of biological weapons factories on wheels and rails, which could be easily moved and were designed to evade detection by inspectors. In a matter of months, they could produce a quantity of biological poison equal to the entire amount that Iraq claimed to have produced in the years prior to the Gulf War.\nHe said that, during previous inspections, the United Nations inspectors had had only vague hints of that programme. The confirmation had come only in 2000, from an Iraqi chemical engineer who supervised one of those facilities. His account had been corroborated by other sources. Iraq had at least seven of those sophisticated mobile biological weapons factories. In fact, they could produce enough dry biological agent in a month to kill thousands upon thousands of people. From Iraq's past admissions, it was known that it had successfully weaponized not only anthrax, but also other biological agents, including aflatoxin and ricin.\nIraq had also investigated dozens of biological agents causing diseases, he continued, such as gas gangrene, plague, typhus, cholera and haemorrhagic fever. It had developed ways to disperse lethal biological agents, widely, indiscriminately, into the water supply and into the air. In 1995, an Iraqi military officer, Mujahid Salh Abdul Latif, had told inspectors that Iraq intended the spray tanks to be mounted onto an MIG-21 that had been converted into an unmanned aerial vehicle, or UAV. Iraq had also admitted to producing four spray tanks, but to this day it had provided no credible evidence that they had been destroyed. There could be no doubt that Saddam Hussein had biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more. It also had the ability to dispense those lethal poisons and diseases in ways that caused massive death and destruction.\nTurning to chemical weapons, he said that it was important to keep in mind that Saddam Hussein had used those horrific weapons on another country and on his own people. In fact, in the history of chemical warfare, no country had more battlefield experience with chemical weapons since the First World War than Iraq. Saddam Hussein had also never accounted for vast amounts of chemical weaponry - 550 artillery shells with mustard, 30,000 empty munitions and enough precursors to increase his stockpile to as much as 500 tons of chemical agents. Considering just one category of missing weaponry - 6,500 bombs from the Iran-Iraq war - the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission (UNMOVIC) had said that the amount of chemical agent in them would be on the order of 1,000 tons. The United States had evidence that those weapons existed, but there was no evidence from Iraq that they had been destroyed.\nIraq's record on chemical weapons was replete with lies, he said. It had taken years for Iraq to admit that it had produced four tons of the deadly nerve agent VX. To this day, Iraq was denying that it had ever weaponized VX. Yet, on 27 January, UNMOVIC had told the Council that it had information that conflicted with the Iraqi account of its VX programme.\nIraq had embedded key portions of its illicit chemical weapons infrastructure within its legitimate civilian industry, he continued. Even to experts, that infrastructure looked like an ordinary civilian operation. The inspectors would be unlikely to turn up anything prohibited, especially if there was warning that they were coming. \""</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 26628 | 0.6195237954 | 3.310583433 | 0.7498341566 | 1.7367999587 | I | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Situated below Gran Sasso mountain in Italy, it is well known for particle physics research by the INFN. In addition to a surface portion of the laboratory, there are extensive underground facilities beneath the mountain. The nearest towns are L'Aquila and Teramo. The facility is located about 120\u00a0km from Rome.\n\nThe primary mission of the laboratory is to host experiments that require a low background environment in the fields of astroparticle physics and nuclear astrophysics and other disciplines that can profit of its characteristics and of its infrastructures.\nThe LNGS is, like the three other European underground astroparticle laboratories (Laboratoire Souterrain de Modane, Laboratorio subterr\u00e1neo de Canfranc, and Boulby Underground Laboratory), a member of the coordinating group ILIAS.\n\nFacilities\nThe laboratory consists of a surface facility, located within the Gran Sasso and Monti della Laga National Park, and extensive underground facilities located next to the 10\u00a0km long Traforo del Gran Sasso freeway tunnel.\n\nThe first large experiments at LNGS ran in 1989; the facilities were later expanded, and it is now the largest underground laboratory in the world.\n\nThere are three main barrel vaulted experimental halls, each approximately 20\u00a0m wide, 18\u00a0m tall, and 100\u00a0m long. These provide roughly 3\u00d720\u00d7100= of floor space and 3\u00d720\u00d7(8+10\u00d7\u03c0/4)\u00d7100= of volume. Including smaller spaces and various connecting tunnels, the facility totals  and .\n\nThe experimental halls are covered by about 1400\u00a0m of rock, protecting the experiments from cosmic rays. Providing about 3400 metres of water equivalent (mwe) shielding, it is not the deepest underground laboratory, but the fact that it can be driven to without using mine elevators makes it very popular.\n\nResearch projects\n\nNeutrino research\nSince late August 2006, CERN has directed a beam of muon neutrinos from the CERN SPS accelerator to the Gran Sasso lab, 730\u00a0km away, where they are detected by the OPERA and ICARUS detectors, in a study of neutrino oscillations that will improve on the results of the Fermilab to MINOS experiment.\n\nIn May 2010, Lucia Votano, Director of the Gran Sasso laboratories, announced, \"The OPERA experiment has reached its first goal: the detection of a tau neutrino obtained from the transformation of a muon neutrino, which occurred during the journey from Geneva to the Gran Sasso Laboratory.\" This was the first observed tau neutrino candidate event in a muon neutrino beam, providing further evidence that neutrinos have mass. (Research first determined that neutrinos have mass in 1998 at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino detector.) Neutrinos must have mass for this transformation to occur; this is a deviation from the classic Standard Model of particle physics, which assumed that neutrinos are massless.\n\nAn effort to determine the Majorana/Dirac nature of the neutrino, called CUORE (Cryogenic Underground Observatory for Rare Events), is operating in the laboratory (as of 2018). The detector is shielded with lead recovered from an ancient Roman shipwreck, due to the ancient lead's lower radioactivity than recently minted lead. The artifacts were given to CUORE from the National Archaeological Museum in Cagliari.\n\nIn September 2011, Dario Autiero, a researcher of Institute of Nuclear Physics in Lyons, France, presented preliminary findings that indicated neutrinos produced at CERN were arriving at OPERA detector about 60\u00a0ns earlier than they would if they were travelling at the speed of light. This faster-than-light neutrino anomaly was not immediately explained. The results were subsequently investigated and confirmed to be wrong. They were caused by a flawed optic fiber cable in OPERA receiver of the laboratory, resulting in late arrival of the clock signal to which the neutrinos' arrivals were compared. Although the official statement published by OPERA does not declare"</details> | 1024 | Wikipedia | 40466 | 1.1071282481 | 3.3034209187 | 1.8607077257 | 1.5234875967 | E | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 |

Decades long projects have realised development of all types of missile systems including ballistic, cruise, anti-ship, air-defence, air-to-air and anti-missile systems. India is one of seven countries in the world with intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and one of four countries with anti-ballistic missile systems. Since 2016, India has been a member of Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR).\n\nThe use of rockets for warfare in India has been recorded in as early as the 18th century. Mysorean rockets were the first iron-cased rockets in world that were successfully deployed for military use. Mysore's conflict with East India Company exposed British to the technology leading to development of Congreve rockets and introduction of rocketry in Europe.\n\nResearch in missile technology resumed again after India's independence along with the weapons of mass destruction. Development of nuclear weapons was followed by various missile programs in 70s with development of various ballistic, cruise, surface to air, anti- ballistic missile and orbital launch systems. India conducted its first nuclear test and initiated with Project Devil as an attempt to reverse engineer Soviet surface to air missile SA-2 Guideline and Project Valiant to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile. However, it could not succeed and experience gained led to development of Prithvi series of short range ballistic-missiles. In early 80s, India conducted its first successful orbital launch and synchronized its research institutions under IGMDP and successfully developed a series of strategic missile systems. The project began in early 1980s and ended in 2008, after these strategic missiles were successfully developed. The last major missile developed under the program was the Agni 3 intermediate-range ballistic missile which was successfully tested on 9 July 2007. Since then, India has developed, tested, operationalized, and is developing several missile systems that are limited to only a handful of countries including ICBMs, ASATs, SLBMs and hypersonic weapon systems. Threats posed by enemy missile systems led to the pursuit of Indian Ballistic Missile Defense Programme.\n\nIn 2017, India produced most of defined MTCR defined missile technologies required to be integrated to produce most missile systems. As per G Satheesh Reddy, India achieved complete self reliance in missile technology.\n\nHistory\n\nKingdom of Mysore \n\nMysorean rockets were the first iron-cased rockets that were successfully deployed for military use. Kingdom of Mysore utilised them effectively in the conflicts against the British East India Company. In addition, wheeled rocket launchers capable of launching five to ten rockets almost simultaneously were used in war. These rockets were re-engineered as Congreve rockets by British opening the door of development of advanced rocketry further in Europe.\n\nPost-independence \nIndian government constituted a teamd Special Weapons Development Team in 1958 to study guided missile systems.\n\nThe phase-I of missile program was limited to development of a first generation anti-tank guided missile (ATGM) by DRDO. Liquid fuel rocket engines based on Soviet missile system SA-2 were developed. Despite the overall failure of DRDO to develop a reliable ATGM, Indian laboratories had established facilities useful for machining and fabricating various parts of missile systems including gyroscopes, actuators, silver oxide-zinc\nbatteries, booster and sustainer motors, air frame hard-\nware such as fiberglass wings, ground launcher mecha-\nnisms, and wire spool winding and reeling mechanisms. India later excepted the French offer to produce SS-11B anti-tank guided missiles in 1970s. In another phase initiated in 1970s, Project Devil to reverse engineer Soviet SA-2 Guideline and Project Valiant to develop an Inter-continental ballistic missile too ended up with limited success but imparting experience and facilities for further research on missiles and space rockets. DRDO simultaneously focused on building a guidance package \u2013 an essential part of a long-range missile that determines its path and accuracy to hit a target.

Farmers produced enough food to support a non-agricultural population that included artisans who produced non-agricultural goods, administrators who collected taxes and set rules and regulations for society, and soldiers who defended or expanded the territory under the government's control.\n\nIn contrast to many other societies, the early Chinese accepted the world and human existence as facts of life that needed no supernatural explanation or divine creator. They assumed the world was a friendly place, and they credited advancements in civilization to human beings, not to gods or divinities. This optimistic humanism became one of the distinctive aspects of Chinese thought and culture up to modern times. It stands in sharp contrast to the ancient Greek fascination with tragedies, to the jealous tribal God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and to the elaborate metaphysical speculations of Indian mystics.\n\nAmong the most important cultural heroes in China's earliest historical records were three \"sage-kings,\" Yao, Shun, and Yu, who were known particularly for their virtue and their loving concern for the welfare of their subjects. Yao passed his throne on to Shun rather than his own son because Shun was clearly superior to all others in his devotion to the public welfare. Shun, in turn, chose as his successor an engineer, Yu, who tamed the floods of China's major rivers. In this early conception of the state, rulers were seen as analogous to parents, and the state was seen as the family writ large. Having established prosperity by taming China's rivers, Yu passed on his political authority to his own son, thus beginning what came to be known in the historical record as the Xia dynasty, traditionally dated 2200\u20131750 BCE. Around 1750, the Xia was overtaken by rulers of the Shang, which remained in power for about seven hundred years.\n\nThere probably was some regional power around 2000 BCE known as the Xia, but it has not yet been verified by the archeological record. In the 1930s, archeologists proved the historicity of the Shang dynasty by discovering its capital through an unlikely coincidence. During a malaria epidemic in 1899, drugstores in and around Beijing did a lively business selling \"dragon bones,\" believed to cure the illness when ground up and served in a soup. One day a scholar of ancient Chinese culture was stunned to see on one of these dragon bones a very early form of Chinese writing. His discovery eventually led archeologists to begin excavations at Anyang, a source of these bones in the north central province of Henan. There they uncovered the tombs of the last thirteen kings of the Shang dynasty.\n\n\"Dragon bones\" were in fact the flat undersides of turtle shells and the shoulder blades of cattle. The ancient writing on them came from the practice of divination or the consultation of ancestral spirits by the rulers of the Shang dynasty. Shang diviners first drilled a hole into the bone and posed a yes-or-no question to an ancestral spirit. When they inserted a red-hot bronze rod into the drilled hole, the intense heat made cracks in the bone. The diviners (Shang kings and their shaman-like advisors) then interpreted the configuration of the cracks to answer the question. Artisans then carved on the cracked bone the date, the name of the diviner, the spirit consulted, the question, and the answer provided. In this curious way, \"dragon bone soup,\" whether it cured malaria or not, led scholars to discover Shang oracle bones, providing a unique window on early Bronze Age China.\n\nAnyang, it turned out, was the Shang capital at the height of its power (around 1300\u20131000 BCE). In 1950, an earlier Shang capital, with similar archaeological findings, was discovered in Zhengzhou, directly south of Anyang. Today we have more than 100,000 oracle bones from Shang sites, and scholars have deciphered roughly 2,000 characters (also called ideog"</details> | 1024 | Book | 28901 | 2.0795978027 | 3.2031457181 | 2.6976672641 | 1.5338930778 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

Cliona Curley, programme director with CybersafeIreland, cautions against a kneejerk reaction to particular cases \u2013 they are markers of the huge issue this is.\n\"There is no magic legislative or technological solution,\" she says, although there is certainly a place for progress on both.\n\"We need leadership at a Government level; we do need to look at legislative gaps, and the technology platforms need to be doing a lot more but the reality is our focus must be on educating children and supporting parents in ensuring that their children grow up using technology in a safe way and in a smart way.\"\nExtremely complicated\nThere is no one lever that can be pulled to fix what is, in reality, an extremely complicated issue, says solicitor Simon McGarr. \"As we can see from this week, there's been a race from various TDs to rush to pull the lever because it's labelled child safety and that would look good.\"\nBut the Government can't fix it and, if it tries to do so, the danger is it we'll regret its interference, he warns. While he praises the \"excellent\" 2016 Law Reform Commission report on \"Harmful Communications and Digital Safety\", he's not convinced that its recommendation for a Digital Safety Commissioner, modelled on comparable offices in Australia and New Zealand, is a solution in itself.\nHowever, the Minister for Communications, Denis Naughten, announced on Thursday that he is consulting on the need for such a regulator. An open policy debate will be held in Dublin on March 8th to raise awareness of what the Government, Europe and the industry are doing \u2013 and must do \u2013 to tackle harmful on-line content.\nA Government spokesman says that the Taoiseach is supportive of the work being undertaken by Naughten and that he believes the major tech companies, which operate on an international basis, should do more to mediate the content available on their websites and social media platforms.\nThe ISPCC had been lobbying for a commissioner and Long says until there are regulatory standards in place, that hold all technological media companies to account, those who do act responsibly can't be recognised and, more importantly, we can't see those who aren't taking child safety seriously. With cyber safety being \"the child protection issue of our time\", she does not believe self-regulation is enough.\nMeanwhile, she has huge sympathy for parents who are navigating a very difficult area. \"Don't beat yourself up about not being an expert but find the answers,\" she urges.\nTechnical aspects\nParents can get very caught up on the technical aspects of protecting children online, but basically it's a parenting issue, says \u00c1ine Lynch of the National Parents' Association (Primary).\nJust as children are taught to cross roads, going from having their hand held tightly, to parents walking beside them, then perhaps observing from a distance before trusting them to mind themselves, so it should be with navigating the online world.\nShe doesn't believe it is helpful to give parents a blanket warning about certain apps because most can be used for good as well as bad, and there are always new ones coming on the market.\n\"While Snapchat is getting a bad press at the moment, lots of children use it very healthily,\" she points out.\nWe very much understand the changing nature of technology and the internet, and for many parents this can be one of the biggest concerns\[nWebwise.ie](http://nwebwise.ie/) has a dedicated team providing parents with explanations on how various apps work, their appeal to children/teenagers and potential risks.

The rest of the period turned into a 3 on 3 between Giricek, McCants, and Turkcan against MacDonald, Parker, and Burstein. McCants put his team up by two at the 26 minute mark before Parker put his team up swishing a three. Turkcan then added a bucket for 49-50 before Burstein added one of his own for 51-50. In the end it was CSKA coming out on top, and holding onto a slim 52-54 lead as the teams headed into the decisive final period. McCants led all scorers with 17 points, Giricek had 16 and Turkcan had 14 for CSKA while Burstein led the Yellows with 15.\nThe fourth period was all about intensity and nerves. The two teams played such swarming defenses that the high powered offense of Maccabi, and the Euroleague high scoring tandem of Turkcan and GIricek could barely get anything going. What they couldn't do on offense though they made up for it on defense. In a consecutive series of plays three minutes into the period, Turkcan swatted away an attempt by Huffman at one end, followed by a huge block by MacDonald on Turkcan at the other, who then found his revenge in another enormous block as Huffman went up for the shot. At the 34 minute mark, the score was 52-55,the only difference being a Turckan free throw. The teams finally turned it on in the closing minutes. Halfway through the period, CSKA pulled out to a 4-point advantage, 57-61, and it looked as though they would run away with it but MacDonald would not give up. Leading his team back, Huffman, and Parker each contributed in a 7-2 run that tied the game at 63-63 with just over two minutes to play.\nAs the game was on the line, both teams turned to their key players. Turkcan shorted a three from the right corner before Huffman shorted an easy 7-footer at the other end off which CSKA grabbed the rebound and marched calmly down the court for last possession with 20 seconds left. Giricek, dribbled at the top of the arc waiting for the clock to run down. The entire Maccabi defense collapsed on him as drove into the lane and as he went up the referees called Henefield for his fourth foul putting Giricek on the line for two free throws with 5.3 seconds left. He missed the first but nailed the second to give CSKA a 67-68 lead, and possible victory. Maccabi hurried the inbounds pass and gave it off to MacDonald who streaked down the right side. As he appraoched the arc, he picked up his dribble. MacDonald passed by Giricek coming off a screen who barely grazed him with his hips, and he let a shot go up which rimmed out, but Maccabi was saved by the refs who blew Giricek for his fourth which sent MacDonald to the line with 1.5 seconds to go. MacDonald cooly sank both attempts, his first two of the night. And as CSKA sent a desperation lob down court to no one, the 10,000 strong in Yad Eliyahu arena erupted as the Maccabi bench poured on to the court in celebration of the 69-68 victory.\nEran Sela, Tel Aviv\nReferees: RAMOS, MATEO; TSANIDIS, STAVROS; COLUCCI, GENARO\nMaccabi Elite 18 18 16 17\nMaccabi Elite\n4 HENEFELD, NADAV 28:00 2 1/1 1 2 3 2 1 4 4 1 1\n6 SHARP, DERRICK 21:00 10 2/5 2/3 1 1 1 1 3 4\n7 HUFFMAN, NATE 27:00 12 4/9 0/3 4/8 4 8 12 2 1 2 1 7 17\n8 PARKER, ANTHONY 38:00 14 3/9"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 51445 | -0.0207994677 | 0.0164983291 | -1.0145375786 | -0.6232932171 | O | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 |

Therefore, it is very conceivable that close connections exist between the Loomis-Whitney inequality (\\ref{cylinderLW}) and the multilinear restriction estimate (\\ref{multilinearineq}).\n\nOne then naturally wonders whether (\\ref{cylinderLW}) can be used to prove (\\ref{multilinearineq}). However, a glaring technical issue presents itself: For the multilinear restriction theorem there are other sharp examples where the main wave packets for each $f_j$ are essentially supported on disjoint $R^{\\frac{1}{2}}-$tubes, but the directions of tubes slightly vary. See Figure \\ref{MRpic}. In this setting, the amount of overlapping between different families of wave packet supports (i.e. supports of wave packets coming from $f_j$) should intuitively still be well-controlled but is not directly estimated by (\\ref{cylinderLW}), since (\\ref{cylinderLW}) only allow parallel tubes. This is the motivation of Bennett-Carbery-Tao when they developed a multilinear Kakeya estimate, which can be viewed as a much more robust version of (\\ref{cylinderLW}) allowing perturbations'' of the directions of tubes within a family.

The President is also responsible for ensuring that the decisions of the Congress and the Executive Committee are implemented \"by the Administration\", which confirms the latter's role. Generally speaking, therefore, the situation of the UEFA with regard to the balance of power does not seem to raise any issues.\n55.\tI also note that, compared to the situation analysed by our committee in the context of the report on \"The reform of football governance\", a major improvement has taken place. We had suggested to UEFA that it limit the duration of the terms of office of the President and the other senior officials elected, including the Executive Committee; UEFA has followed this recommendation.\n56.\tArticle 22.1 of the new UEFA Statutes states that \"[n]o person may serve as President or member of the Executive Committee for more than three terms of office (whether consecutive or not). Any partial term of office shall count as one full term\". Article 22.2 keeps the already existing age limit: \"A person aged 70 or more shall not be eligible for election or re-election.\"\n57.\tMoreover, Article 21.3 stipulates that each member of the Executive Committee to be elected by the Congress, except for the President, \"shall hold active office in their association\". The idea is to promote closer links between the UEFA Executive Committee and the national associations, thus avoiding \"political parachuting\". Finally, it is henceforth stipulated (Article 22.1) that 50% of the Executive Committee shall be elected (or re-elected every two years), thereby applying the principle of gradual renewal of the terms of office of members of this body.\n58.\tConcerning the other bodies, the requirement of independence \u2013 which is also upheld by detailed provisions intended to prevent conflicts of interests \u2013 is specifically underlined with regard to members of the organs for the administration of justice. In this respect, Article 32.1 of the Statutes stipulates that they \"are independent and may not belong to any other organ or Committee of UEFA. They shall not take any measure nor exercise any influence in relation to a matter where any conflict of interests exists or is perceived to exist. They are bound exclusively by the UEFA Statutes, rules and regulations and the law\".\n59.\tThese provisions are sound. I nevertheless have some observations and proposals for improvement:\nThere does not seem to be any verification of eligibility and independence prior to appointment, or at least they are not codified. The introduction of specific statutory provisions in this respect should be considered.\nArticle 32.2 stipulates that \"[m]embers of the Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body and Appeals Body as well as the Ethics and Disciplinary Inspectors shall be elected by the Executive Committee (from candidates proposed by the Member Associations) for a term of four years. Members of the Club Financial Control Body shall be elected by the Executive Committee for a term of four years. The elected members of the UEFA's Organs for the Administration of Justice shall be presented to the Congress for ratification\". This means that the UEFA Executive Committee plays a decisive role in the choice of members, which may be incompatible with their real independence, particularly given that their (four-year) term of office is indefinitely renewable. Consequently, even though it should be noted that, in practice, it does not appear that there are any problems of interference in the functioning of judicial bodies, they should envisage changing their methods so that the President of the Control, Ethics and Disciplinary Body and the Head Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector are chosen through transparent procedures, that candidates are able to apply not only from member associations but also from other stakeholders and that the persons concerned are elected (and possibly dismissed) by the Congress based on a preselected list (of at least three members) and a list of suggestions justified by the Executive Committee.\nThere should be limits for the members' terms of office and these terms of office should begin and end at different times to ensure that they do not all expire at the same time, in order to ensure continuity of the work. The rules applicable to the members of the Executive Committee could serve as a model.\n3.\tFootball governance and human"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 8066 | 0.5880212605 | 0.0162745005 | 0.6154133823 | 1.1957149429 | C | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

This is where LED can help. \"Some lecture theatres might not have the height but they have the width, and they want to have more of a digital canvas. The only way to achieve this with sightlines from the audience in the back of the room is to widen the screen. This is another reason why the technology will be so popular in this space is because it's digital Lego, you can make the aspect ratios to suit the requirement,\" says Banks.\nThere was never a lack of desire when it came to LED admits Basi, \"It was just the case of what was practical from a budgeting perspective. As the pricing of LED has become a bit more palatable, we're now getting inquiries on a much more frequent basis.\" Despite a growth in sales, LED still makes up a small part of the market for integrators in higher education installs Basi says. \"I would probably put it around the 5% mark (of LED in total HE installs), but we have to put that into context, this summer we've delivered around 1,000 rooms, based on the quantity of rooms it's around 5%. But from a spend perspective as a value it's quite a reasonable chunk in comparison to the LFD and projection spent, I would actually argue it's not far off competing with the projection spend.\"\nThe 5% figure may sound small, but it shows how the high price has put off HE in the past. What it also shows is the big opportunity that lies ahead for integrators because the desire to buy LED is clearly there.The pricing of LED, a key issue to its adoption so far, is often in line with its pixel pitch. The finer the pixel pitch, the higher the cost. What is the sweet spot right now for LED in HE where price meets quality? \"We've found 1.5mm is the sweet spot because some of the seats are right at the front of the room so the content will be looked at close up,\" says Basi. \"We found when you have a desktop icon app or you're viewing a spreadsheet for example, there's a certain level of detail needed to be seen. The only time customers maybe go for 2.5mm is if they've got a particularly big lecture theatre. As time goes on 1.2mm will probably become the norm.\"\nOne key aspect in driving adoption has been the introduction of all-in-one packages from LED vendors. It is demystifying some of the myths of installing LED in the minds of buyers says Banks. \"Previously LED was seen as a little bit of a black art. People sometimes panic and ask 'how am I going to get a 162-in screen in a room?' but we have to explain it's modular. The all-in-one packages certainly help people understand more about LED.\" Basi agrees; \"Before it had to be fully designed and factored, now LG for example has a 136-in LED ready to go, everything's built-in, it's literally out of the box, hang it, power it up, and away you go.\" It's something other vendors such as Absen are looking at too, as Banks outlines; \"The all-in-one LED market is a huge growth area for us. They are being positioned in the same way an LFD would be positioned and ultimately sold.\"\nThe Absen packages come in different sizes (110-in, 136-in and 162-in) as a modular kit, with everything you need to install it in one package.\n\"We are seeing an uptake of those in smaller teaching spaces or meeting/collaboration rooms where a 98-in LCD screen is not big enough,\" Banks adds. The all-in-one packages have been designed for meeting rooms and collaboration rooms, \"but in reality when you've got 110-in seamless display that can start to cannibalise any application in a university or a college where the alternative is to buy to a 2x2 of 55-inch LCDs. It's the same size physically (110-in diagonally) but it's completely seamless, and it's got a longer life.\"\nIf LED is now being specified by system integrators, what technology is it typically replacing? \"We're seeing a migration with end users wanting to explore LED as a"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 44872 | 0.2853229907 | 0.0162745005 | 0.4809926079 | 0.0862305235 | E | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

However, there will always be against this system the objection that it could hardly be compatible with a system of common ownership of land and the necessaries for production. Communism in the possession of land, factories, etc. and individualism in production are too contradictory to coexist in the same society\u2014to say nothing of the difficulty of estimating the market value or the selling value of a product by the average time that is necessary, or the time that was actually used, in producing it. To bring men to agree upon such an estimation of their work would already require a deep penetration of the communist principle into their ideas\u2014at least, for all produce of first necessity. And if a community introduced, as a further concession to individualism, a higher payment for skilled work, or chances of promotion in a hierarchy of functionaries, this would reintroduce all those inconveniences of the present wage system which are combatted now by the workers.\n\nTo some extent the same remark applies to the American anarchist individualists who were represented in the fifties by S. P. Andrews and W. Greene, later on by Lysander Spooner, and now are represented by Benjamin Tucker, the well-known editor of the New York Liberty. Their ideas are partly those of Proudhon, but partly also those of Herbert Spencer. They start from the principle that the only law which is obligatory for the anarchist is to mind his own business, and not to meddle with that of others; that each individual and each group has the right to oppress all mankind\u2014if they have the force to do so; and that if this only law, of minding one's own business, had received a general and complete application, it would offer no danger, because the rights of each individual would have been limited by the equal rights of all others.\n\nBut to reason in this way is to pay, in our opinion, too large a tribute to metaphysical dialectics, and to ignore the facts of real life. It is impossible to conceive a society in which the affairs of any one of its members would not concern many others members, if not all; still less a society in which a continual contact between its members would not have established an interest of every one towards all others, which would render it impossible to act without thinking of the effects which our actions may have on others.\n\nThis is why Tucker, like Spencer, after his admirable criticism of the State and a vigorous defense of the rights of the individual, comes to recognize the right of defense of its members by the State. But it was precisely by assuming the function of \"defense\" of its weaker members that the State in its historical evolution developed all its aggressive functions, which Spencer and Tucker have so brilliantly criticized.\n\nThis contradiction is probably the reason why anarchist individualism, while it finds followers amongst the middle-class intellectuals, does not spread amongst the workers. It must be said, however, that it renders a real service in preventing the anarchist communists from making too many concessions to the old idea of State officialism. Old ideas are so difficult to get rid of.\n\nAs to anarchist communism, it is certain that this solution wins more and more ground nowadays among those workingmen who try to get a clear conception as to the forthcoming revolutionary action. The syndicalist and trade union movements, which permit the workingmen to realize their solidarity and to feel the community of their interests much better than any elections, prepare the way for these conceptions And it is hardly too much to hope that when some serious movement for the emancipation of labor begins in Europe and America, attempts will be made, at least in the Latin countries, in the anarchist-communist direction\u2014much deeper than anything that was done by the French nation in 1793-94.\n\n# ANARCHISM AND THE LAW\n\nWhen we are told that Law (written with a capital letter) \"is the objectification of Truth;\" or that \"the principles underlying the development of Law are the same as those underlying the development of the human spirit;\" or that \"Law and Morality are identical and differ only formally"</details> | 1024 | Book | 46781 | 1.378323983 | 0.0162745005 | 0.9578059207 | 1.3101752348 | O | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Readers are handed both a guidebook and compass for personal-professional growth through the intimate narratives of nursing's most adventurous pioneers, boldest activists, and emerging voices. The book includes chapters from renowned leaders who discuss aspects of their professional contributions in detail and guide the reader to unleash his or her future potential through the lens of nursing. These deeply connect the reader to one of the main intentions of the book: to assert and validate that nurses and a nursing sensibility are vital for the continued evolution of humanity and to ensure that dignity, humane caring, and compassionate, courageous leadership continue to pave the path for the profession and beyond. The book also encapsulates the experiences, messages, work to date, and future directions of accomplished and inspiring nurses who are continuing the conversations started by those who have laid the groundwork or claiming a new domain with which readers can coidentify. It further provides alternate views of nursing as a discipline, promoting leadership capacity for the reader and encouraging individuality and authenticity in nursing praxis.\nGo to book: Practicing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Children and Adolescents\nPracticing Cognitive Behavioral Therapy With Children and Adolescents:\nA Guide for Students and Early Career Professionals\nThis book is dedicated specifically to increasing the confidence and professional competence of graduate students and early career professionals who use cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with children and adolescents. It shows some opening remarks for mental health professionals (MHPs) and trainees who are new to doing CBT and positive psychology (PP) treatments with kids suffering from an internalizing disorder. Behavioral activation is a tried-and-true stable of CBT. A common presenting complaint among depressed or stressed kids is poor sleep. The book shows some of the strategies for combating insomnia. Problem solving is another staple of CBT. The methodology for problem solving is a little bit different if it is done with an individual kid or in a family session. The factors to be considered to introduce communications training and problem solving in a family or an individual session are: age, maturity level, and psychological mindedness of the child. Exposure procedure is used for kids who are treated for anxiety. This chapter shows a list of common exposures among anxious youth. Physiological calming and coping thoughts are the two popular techniques for supporting exposures. Involving the parent is often key with doing exposures. The book also presents some of the principles and methodologies with regard to parent interactions. It is important for parents to be open with their kid about their thinking about the value of a mental health evaluation. Sometimes parents ask for guidance about how to have the discussion with their kid.\nGo to book: A Guide to the Standard EMDR Therapy Protocols for Clinicians, Supervisors, and Consultants\nA Guide to the Standard EMDR Therapy Protocols for Clinicians, Supervisors, and Consultants, 2nd Edition\nThe book describes updated information on mechanisms of action of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy. It delivers clear, concise treatment guidelines for students, practicing clinicians, supervisors, clinic directors, and hospital administrators involved in the treatment of those with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), Specific Phobias, and Panic Disorder. In EMDR therapy, various strategies can be employed to support the goals of stabilization and symptom reduction. Some stabilization strategies commonly used in EMDR therapy were developed in other traditions such as progressive relaxation, self-hypnosis, biofeedback, and meditation. The book provides an overview of the standard eight-phase model of EMDR therapy and the general three-pronged protocol that provides the framework for the specific treatment protocols for diagnostic groups. It briefly touches on clinical situations where the general principle of treatment planning based on the three-pronged protocol must give way to an initially inverted protocol"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 68659 | 0.5414522959 | 0.0162745005 | 2.383173377 | 0.7430765163 | A | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

According to instructional design expert McTighe, \"Learning is enhanced when teachers think purposefully about curricular planning\u2026 and effective curriculum is planned backward from longterm desired results or outcomes.\" Other scholars note this point as well, adding that purposeful selection of activities and content leads to improved student performance.\nIf student success is tied to effective teaching, community college educators need professional development to progress and grow as teaching experts. Metaphorically, the instructor is the stylobate of the pillar, and his or her subject area expertise is only part of the composition of that foundation. For institutions that embrace Guided Pathways, the opportunity and faculty imperative of the fourth pillar is to build capacity in areas that support effective teaching and learning through professional development. This process should include assessment training in addition to learning opportunities based in instructional design.\nGuiding questions regarding professional development: What professional development opportunities are available to help faculty build skills for instructional design and course planning? How can the college ensure adequate resources are available to faculty to improve teaching skills? What pathway is available for faculty to become teaching experts? How does the college prioritize and make training accessible for part-time faculty?\nThe Guided Pathways movement is designed to help community college students \"progress more quickly and with a higher chance of completion.\" The Four Pillar Model was implemented by the California Community Colleges Chancellor's Office to give colleges a \"highly structured approach to student success.\" The plan was to disrupt traditional institutional practices in order to achieve widespread organizational change that would positively impact students and reduce equity gaps. Some faculty bristle at the overused phrase \"student success\" or are skeptical of the imposed new structure. These educators should remember that the fourth pillar is their domain, a part of the 10+1 areas of academic senate purview. Faculty have the opportunity to define, shape and implement their institutions' Guided Pathways approaches to helping students succeed. The fourth pillar situates faculty as agents of improvement and designers of student-centered learning systems. That faculty have purview in this area is important because studies suggest that faculty can contribute to educational equity and increasing student success. Specifically, the research links success to intentionally designed courses and faculty-student interactions.\nIn one study, \"transparency,\" explained as, \"structuring learning experiences to meet the needs of students,\" improved underserved students' educational experiences. In another study, the Center for Community College Student Engagement examined the experiences of men of color and identified four areas of importance for student success: personal connections, high expectations, instructor qualities such as showing interest in students, and engagement. If student success is tied to effective teaching and relationships, community college educators need to know how to design, assess, and evaluate the entire learning system, focusing not only what they teach but also on how they teach. This perspective creates a new set of goals or outcomes. In this system, student learning outcomes describe where faculty want students to go and allow faculty to measure whether the students got there, and equity outcomes are used to describe and measure faculty responsiveness to diversity while teaching. Based on Linton's Equity Framework, equity outcomes applied to instructional design would include the following characteristics: expectations, rigor, relevancy, and relationships.\nWork in the fourth pillar begins with faculty acknowledging their roles as the designers of the learning system and with a willingness to apply the equity framework to their design. This approach, too, is a fourth pillar imperative: to operationalize equity, create equity outcomes, and commit to instructional design practices that help faculty attend to diversity. For example, when built into the design of the learning system, SLO assessment may tell faculty to increase the amount of practice students need to develop a new skill, while equity outcomes assessment may reveal that students do not see themselves in the content. The goal is to create a learning system that simultaneously considers unique student needs and evaluates design elements such as outcomes, assessment, lesson plans, and the instructional environment. This new and equitable assessment and design intervention could prove an innovative strategy to improve teaching and learning. In addition, at its core this approach may help educators form a more complete picture of the learning system.\nGuiding questions on instructional design: How will interactions in my classroom affect learning?

Identify aspects of a text that reveal an author's point of view or purpose.\nWHSS.6-8.2. Write arguments focused on discipline-specific content.\nStep 1: Have students read San Francisco's Chinatown background essay OR view a clip from the film Becoming American (Disc 2, first 9 minutes of Chapter 1). After reading/viewing, lead a discussion about what kind of community was San Francisco's Chinatown in the 1890s. Points to bring out in discussion include:\nlike \"a country within a country\"; an immigrant community; \"bachelor\" society as a result of exclusion laws; refuge from violence; residents from diverse regions, speaking different dialects; opera and other familiar culture available; stores served as gathering places, hiring halls\nStep 2: Divide the class into five groups and assign each group one Chinatown place: grocery store, restaurant, theater, school, Six Companies self-help association. There is one photograph and one text document for each place. Hand these out to the groups, along with the worksheet. (Optional: Divide the class into four groups and use one of the photographs as a model.)\nStep 3: Allow students to examine the photograph first, and use Part I of the worksheet to make a list of observations about what people, objects and activities they see. Groups should then decide on three inferences that they can make based on these observations, as well as any questions about the photograph they have.\nThen, ask students to read the text documents and use Part II of the worksheet to compare \"insider\" and \"outsider\" perspectives.\nWhile groups are working, pass out five pieces of chart paper around the classroom, each with one of the five photographs already attached.\nStep 4: Groups should review the information gathered on both sides of their worksheets. Then, on the chart paper, each group will:\nWrite down the inference(s) substantiated by the insider or outsider text and the phrases from the text that support the inference(s)\nCircle the part(s) of the photo that support(s) the inference(s)\nList a question that is still unanswered that the photo raised\nPost the five pieces of chart paper around the classroom.\nStep 5: Divide the students into pairs and have them do a gallery walk of all five photographs. Give them a list of the following historical understandings about Chinatown and ask them to circle which photograph/text supports each photograph:\nHistorical Understandings:\nSan Francisco's Chinatown included residents from different classes and regions of China.\nRestaurant Grocery Theater Six Companies School\nSan Francisco's Chinatown provided familiar cultural traditions to its residents, including foods, goods, and entertainment.\nIn response to exclusion and violence against them, Chinese residents of Chinatown created self-help organizations and educated their children.\nOutside visitors to Chinatown viewed it as exotic and interesting, as well as foreign and threatening.\nShare out responses with the group. Discuss the questions written on the chart paper that were left unanswered.\nStep 6: Have students complete a written assessment of the activity using the following writing prompt:\nAfter the 1906 earthquake destroyed San Francisco, city leaders debated whether or not Chinatown should be rebuilt. Chinatown occupied valuable real estate in the center of town, and some wanted to use the land for other purposes. Imagine you are a resident of Chinatown. Write a letter to a city official in which you argue why your neighborhood should be rebuilt. Use evidence and details you have gathered from the gallery of photographs and accompanying text.\nThe Chinatown envisioned by tourists in the late 19th century promised exoticism and adventure.

These skills will be put to use on your own research project at the end of the course, as well as in your future career.\nOur optional modules will also allow you to explore your own interests, with topics including course design and classroom practice, as well as 'Impacts of Migration' and 'Language, Identity and Policy', which will help prepare you for a teaching career in Europe or further afield.\nOutside of the course, you can take part in our research seminars and conferences, like the Identities in Language conference, or the British Association for Applied Linguistics conference 2016.\nCourse Leader: Dr Sebastian Rasinger.\nYou'll focus on the major themes that have emerged from literature on second language learning over the last three decades. You'll examine some of the research on the second-language acquisition process, look critically at reports of second-language research, and examine some of the theories which endeavour to interpret research evidence. You will be encouraged to use your own language learning and teaching experience to assess the relative merits of such materials. The module is taught through weekly seminars, offered in the early evening to accommodate those who are in part- or full-time employment. You may be asked to prepare or analyse material for presentation and discussion in class. Students taking part in distance delivery will work in small groups with support from the tutor by means of the Virtual Learning Environment, with progress monitored through formative tasks. Your assessment will be in the form of an extended written assignment to be submitted at the end of the module.\nYou'll examine the relationship between language and society, and the construction of discourse in various domains. In the first part of the module you'll explore sociological and sociolinguistic models and theories, such as speech communities, communities of practice and ethnolinguistic vitality, with a particular focus on social variation and stratification across various linguistic levels (phonology, lexicon, syntax). The second part of the module expands the discussion, and you'll explore the notion (or notions) of discourse in both its linguistic and wider meaning, and its construction in and through society and language use. Throughout the module, you'll study methods for the collection and transcription of data, and discover various approaches to linguistic and discourse analysis. These methods and approaches will then be put into context and used in the analysis of the relevant social spheres and domains, such as educational or institutional discourse. By the end of the course, you'll become more familiar with some of the theoretical foundations on which the study of language use is built, and you'll be able to apply the practical techniques of sociolinguistic and discourse analysis. You'll be assessed through coursework consisting of a portfolio of tasks (3,500 words).\nThis module will provide you with an introduction to research methods in preparation for the MA dissertation. Fortnightly sessions will familiarise you with the basic processes of conducting research, including general methodological approaches as well as research ethics. You'll analyse and discuss both qualitative and quantitative data, in order to develop your critical-evaluative skills. Two sessions will be used to introduce you to the main software packages for both qualitative and quantitative research. If you're taking the distance learning option, you'll work on the Virtual Learning Environment in small groups with support from the tutor, with your progress monitored through formative tasks. Your assessment will consist of a portfolio, including an outline plan for a research project, which may become the basis for the dissertation.\nYou will explore the factors involved in the design of language courses and teaching materials, reflecting on one possible process of course design. You will start with an analysis of the context in which the course will take place, the needs of the learners, and current theories of language and language learning. You will move on to consider how course content can be selected and ordered in a principled way, how assessment relates to course design, and how and when courses should be evaluated. Finally, you will consider the evaluation, adaptation and creation of course materials. The face-to-face seminars will be a combination of teacher input, student input and discussion, both in groups and whole class.

Insights from health literacy expert Becca Freed\nIn order to make informed healthcare decisions, patients and caregivers need to be able to understand medical information. This is often complex, and, as highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, can also be contradictory and evolve rapidly. As medical communications professionals, we aim to ensure that we are providing our readers with appropriately written, understandable information. The Publication Plan spoke to Becca Freed, Associate Director, Health Literacy Communications at Health Research for Action, to find out how this goal can be achieved.\nCould you tell us a bit about Health Research for Action and how you came to be involved in health literacy?\n\"Health Research for Action (HRA) is a research centre within the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley. For more than 25 years, the researchers and communications professionals at HRA have conducted participatory research on health disparities, and designed interventions aimed at reducing those disparities. Often those interventions are patient education products.\nI'm a content strategist and the lead writer for HRA. After quite a few years of writing and editing in the tech field, I moved into the healthcare space because it allows me to use my communications skills to advocate for patients. When I evaluate or develop communications with a health literacy lens, I represent the voice of the patient.\"\nWhen I evaluate or develop communications with a health literacy lens, I represent the voice of the patient.\nHealth literacy and health equity are often discussed together. How would you define these terms and how are the two interlinked?\n\"Health literacy is somewhat different for individuals, healthcare providers, and institutions. For individuals, it is the ability to access, understand, and use health information to support their own (or their loved ones') health. At HRA, we lean into the idea that helping people to be health literate helps them act as their own advocates in a healthcare encounter.\nFor healthcare providers, health literacy means being aware of how they can help patients be health literate. A key part of this is giving patients information that is usable and accessible: that is, the right amount of information, at the right time, at the appropriate level of complexity. Doing this well requires empathy \u2013 the ability to put oneself in the patient's shoes.\nFor healthcare providers, health literacy means being aware of how they can help patients be health literate. A key part of this is giving patients information that is usable and accessible.\nFor institutions, health literacy is providing equal, easy, and shame-free access to (and delivery of) healthcare and health information. This requires examining the organisation for ways that the environment or interactions could hinder patients from getting what they need\u2014and working to remove those obstacles.\nHealth equity is a broader concept that analyses how aspects of people's lives (social determinants such as race, education, quality of housing, environmental health hazards, access to food, and access to healthcare) affect their health. Health equity initiatives aim to lower or remove those population-level barriers to good health, so that everyone can have the best health possible for them.\nPromoting health literacy among individuals, healthcare providers, and institutions is a key factor in advancing health equity.\"\nCan you tell us about the challenges faced by those with limited health literacy skills? How important are clear medical communications in empowering patients to make informed healthcare decisions?\n\"Low health literacy can make many aspects of healthcare and self-care difficult. It may mean difficulty reading and following instructions for taking medication, or difficulty understanding what lab results mean. It can mean feeling intimidated in the doctor's office or embarrassed to ask for a more detailed explanation of a procedure or instructions.\nClear, non-shaming healthcare communications anticipate the questions that patients are likely to have about a condition, procedure, or medication. Good healthcare communications also encourage patients to ask questions and take an active role in their care.\nGood healthcare communications also encourage patients to ask questions and take an active role in their care.\nThis can be done by incorporating interactive elements such as questionnaires or checklists into the communication. In a clinical encounter, it can include techniques like teach-back, where a practitioner asks a patient to repeat information back, in order to identify and correct misunderstandings.\"\nIn your experience,"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 53933 | 1.4358503511 | 0.5172028461 | 3.3266550384 | 0.6494271866 | A | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

The University of Nevada, Cooperative Extension created the Senior Autobiography Workshop to help older adults write about their lives in a way that can enhance social and family networks and improve seniors' self-esteem, important factors in maintaining physical and mental well-being. Both the process of life review and the autobiographical final product can produce great mental and emotional benefits. Workshop attendees report having gained insight on the value of their life within the context of their family structure.\nWith the growth of the aging population, Extension is trying to provide meaningful educational programming for seniors. The University of Nevada, Cooperative Extension created the Senior Autobiography Workshop to help older adults write about their lives in a way that can enhance social and family networks and improve seniors' self-esteem, important factors in maintaining physical and mental well-being.\nThis interactive educational program helps older adults create an autobiographical record of their lives with historical value for them and their families. Sharing their life stories and collaborating with peers in the workshop can enhance their sense of social connection. This writing and sharing process can add meaning to seniors' lives by helping them better understand the past and present (Birren & Cochran, 2001).\nThe theoretical basis of the program derives from the body of literature identifying the importance of personal narratives to improve memory and promote self-esteem that can lead to extended independence and more successful aging. This workshop utilizes the social network theoretical model (Heaney & Israel, 1997).\nThe workshop is offered in collaboration with public and private organizations that provide services for the elderly population, primarily at senior centers and older adult housing. While there is a lot of interest in autobiography-related activities, few of these organizations have staff who feel qualified to conduct life history programs. Extension personnel can either conduct the workshop, or they can provide train-the-trainer instruction for staff or volunteers who provide services to the older adult community. Because Extension is the outreach arm of the university, the workshop gives legitimacy to a project that seems formal and academic but is actually informal and personal.\nThe program appeals to seniors from a wide variety of cultural and ethnic backgrounds and from varying educational and income levels. As with other Extension wellness programs for older adults, participants tend to be lifelong learners who constantly try new experiences. They are recruited primarily through newsletters or flyers posted in senior centers and older adult housing complexes.\nInstructor training basically involves providing an outline for the creative and interactive process, such as outlined here. Taught in a minimum of two sessions, the workshop comprises four incremental action steps: to get seniors thinking, talking, writing, and sharing details of their lives.\nFirst, to get workshop attendees thinking about recounting their lives, the instructor describes different approaches to autobiography and the varied ranges of scope from a single page to book-length manuscripts. Program attendees have told their stories in a variety of traditional written formats as well as in poetry, cookbooks, plays, art, photo albums, and songs. Often someone in the class will question the value of their own life story. In response, the instructor asks them, \"How interested would you be to read one paragraph or 100 pages that your parents or grandparents wrote about their lives?\"\nThe next step is to get them talking by asking individualized questions. The process of peer-education usually takes over as they hear others begin reminiscing; this reminds them of incidents from their own lives.\nThe instructor explains there is no wrong approach and offers suggestions on how to create the document in their own style. Participants are given a three-ring, loose-leaf binder, paper, and pens so that they can start jotting notes throughout the session. It is suggested that they start each topic on a separate page in the loose-leaf binder, making it easier to move ideas around as the work progresses.\nQ. What were crucial turning points in your life, the decisions you made, the consequences?\nQ. How did your family spend vacations or celebrate holidays?\nAt the second class, the focus is to get them to share their stories by having them read what they've written to the group. They hear what others have created and that all the stories are interesting, and they see the amazing variety of formats. Workshop attendees also begin to realize the value of what they've"</details> | 1024 | C4 | 6250 | 1.3618878779 | 1.0758789635 | 3.3165100743 | 0.3060463112 | D | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 |

The impact on students depended on how the group work was implemented (e.g., allowing students to choose their groups or giving students time to synthesize their thoughts before sharing with their peers tended to reduce students' anxiety, whereas feeling uncomfortable with group members increased anxiety). Along the same vein, some researchers call on instructors and researchers to not only focus on implementing interactive engagement and group work, but to pay close attention to the dynamics among students in collaborative settings, highlighting the implications for equity and inclusion in our educational environments~\\cite{EddyEtal2015, TraxlerEtal2016, Tonso2006}. In this paper, we respond to that call by investigating the social dynamics of one group of students in a collaborative problem solving setting and explore how the social dynamics are tied to epistemological stances toward group work to effect the differing social positioning of group members.\n\nTanner calls for instructors to design learning environments that attend to both individual students and interactions among students through teaching strategies that cultivate equitable classroom environments (e.g., establish classroom community norms, use varied active learning strategies, assign reporters for small groups)~\\cite{Tanner2013}. Assigning and rotating through specific roles is one way to encourage equitable group discourse, and has been identified in physics as a way to promote effective group work~\\cite{HellerHollabaugh1992}. Eddy \\textit{et al.} call on instructors to structure their classroom activities in a way that promotes equity by understanding the differential participation and barriers to participation in peer discussions for some students~\\cite{EddyEtal2015}. In a study of introductory biology students working in self-selected groups, they found that students' preferred roles in group work were correlated with their social identities (e.g., race, nationality, gender). The authors identified three barriers to participation in peer discussions: exclusion from discussion by group members, anxiety around participating in discussion, and low student perceptions of the value of group work~\\cite{EddyEtal2015}. They argue that in order to promote equitable classroom environments, instructors must first understand the barriers that lead to differential participation in group work. In our case study analysis we identify misalignment of epistemic stances toward group work as a potential barrier to equitable participation in group problem solving.   \n\nIn line with these studies, other researchers have suggested the need to investigate factors that contribute to the construction and productivity of group work environments (e.g.,~\\cite{PollockFinkelsteinKost2007, TurpenFinkelstein2010, Barron2003}). For example, while Lorenzo, Crouch, and Mazur report that use of interactive engagement reduces the gender gap on the Force Concept Inventory (FCI)~\\cite{LorenzoCrouchMazur2006, HestenesWellsSwackhamer1992}, Pollock, Finkelstein, and Kost report that interactive engagement alone is not sufficient and that we must investigate the roles both instructors and students play in constructing norms around collaboration~\\cite{PollockFinkelsteinKost2007}. Thus, in order to investigate the factors that allow social dynamics to support (or hinder) equitable discourse, we must attend to multiple dimensions of group work and the interactions among them.\n\n\\subsection{\\label{sec:multiple-dimensions}Attending to multiple dimensions of group work}\nJust as our community has documented that physics education is about more than content mastery, so too is group work more than assembling several individuals to a common task, or assigning roles to individual group members. In K-12 mathematics education, Barron illustrates through case study analyses how both cognitive and social factors play a role in defining a collaborative mathematics problem solving environment among sixth-grade students~\\cite{Barron2000, Barron2003}. She identified more and less successful groups as defined by problem solving performance and uptake of correct ideas. Less successful'' groups had relational issues'', which included ``competitive interactions, differential efforts to collaborate, and self-focused problem solving trajectories''~\\cite[pg. 348]{Barron2003} that impeded the group's ability to engage in productive problem solving. Barron suggests that one way"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 60388 | 1.6084294551 | 0.9863475345 | 3.2759302179 | 1.7940301046 | D | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

Readers of that kind of world history could get the impression that somehow the rest of the world was made up of exotic people who had strange customs and spoke difficult languages. Still another kind of \"old\" world history presented the story of areas or peoples of the world by focusing primarily on the achievements of great civilizations. One learned of great buildings, influential world religions, and mighty rulers but little of ordinary people or more general economic and social patterns. Interactions among the world's peoples were often described from only one perspective.\n\nThis series tells world history differently. First, it is comprehensive, covering all countries and regions of the world and investigating the total human experience\u2014even those of so-called peoples without histories living far from the great civilizations. \"New\" world historians thus share in common an interest in all of human history, even going back millions of years before there were written human records. A few \"new\" world histories even extend their focus to the entire universe, a \"big history\" perspective that dramatically shifts the beginning of the story back to the Big Bang. Some see the \"new\" global framework of world history today as viewing the world from the vantage point of the Moon, as one scholar put it. We agree. But we also want to take a close-up view, analyzing and reconstructing the significant experiences of all of humanity.\n\nThis is not to say that everything that has happened everywhere and in all time periods can be recovered or is worth knowing, but that there is much to be gained by considering both the separate and interrelated stories of different societies and cultures. Making these connections is still another crucial ingredient of the \"new\" world history. It emphasizes connectedness and interactions of all kinds\u2014cultural, economic, political, religious, and social\u2014involving peoples, places, and processes. It makes comparisons and finds similarities. Emphasizing both the comparisons and interactions is critical to developing a global framework that can deepen and broaden historical understanding, whether the focus is on a specific country or region or on the whole world.\n\nThe rise of the new world history as a discipline comes at an opportune time. The interest in world history in schools and among the general public is vast. We travel to one another's nations, converse and work with people around the world, and are changed by global events. War and peace affect populations worldwide as do economic conditions and the state of our environment, communications, and health and medicine. The New Oxford World History presents local histories in a global context and gives an overview of world events seen through the eyes of ordinary people. This combination of the local and the global further defines the new world history. Understanding the workings of global and local conditions in the past gives us tools for examining our own world and for envisioning the interconnected future that is in the making.\n\nBonnie G. Smith  \nAnand Yang\n\n## Preface\n\nM y purpose in this book is to narrate the long history of China within the larger context of world history. At each step along the way, I will try to address these questions: How has the development of Chinese civilization compared with contemporaneous civilizations elsewhere in the world? What has China shared with other civilizations, and what are the unique or distinctive traits of Chinese civilization? What is the history of China's relations with cultures and peoples beyond its borders? How have foreign peoples\u2014merchants, diplomats, missionaries, and soldiers\u2014affected the development of Chinese civilization? What have been the most important changes and continuities in China's long history?\n\nToday we think of China as the world's oldest continuous civilization. An identifiable and sophisticated Chinese culture emerged by 1500 bce and has shown remarkable continuity in its language, cultural values, and social and political organization over the past three and a half millennia. A major question in the study of China is how such remarkable linguistic, political, and cultural continuity could be maintained for so long over such a large area. Why was China, alone among the early human civilizations, able to sustain political, cultural, and linguistic unity and continuity over an entire subcontinent through a period of three thousand years without the benefit of modern industrial technology?\n\nJared Diamond has noted that all the great civilizations except China's have been melting pots of many divergent peoples, languages, and cultures. And he insightfully adds that China began its early history as \"an ancient melting"</details> | 1024 | Book | 28901 | 2.3151819765 | 1.6918551955 | 3.2049154692 | 1.1853094619 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

The delay can be in any of a number of areas of development, such as movement (motor control), speaking, thinking, playing, or self-care skills.\nApproximately 14% of all toddlers and preschoolers in the United States are classified as having a developmental delay. However, as many as 1 in 4 children through the age of 5 are at risk for a developmental delay or disability. Early identification allows communities to provide more effective and affordable treatment during the preschool years and can lessen the need for expensive special-education services in later childhood.\nIf you are concerned that your child is experiencing developmental delays, please refer to the information below to help you determine if your child is on track with their development.\nThese delays may or may not result from a specific medical condition. For example, a child with Down syndrome is identified at or before birth as having the syndrome but also can have a developmental delay. This fact holds true for any child with a disability, such as autism or cerebral palsy. Children without a specific medical condition, however, may still have a developmental delay. Early assessment is key. Parents should express any concerns, even the slightest ones, to their pediatrician or physical therapist.\nThe United States provides early intervention services for children with developmental delay, although each individual state has its own definition of what \"developmental delay\" is (see Further Reading). As a result, offered services may vary from state to state. Parents can consult with their pediatrician or family physical therapist to determine what services are offered in their state.\nParents are often the first to notice a child isn't hitting their milestones in 1 of the 5 areas of development mentioned above. However, lagging behind on milestone attainment does not necessarily mean a child has a developmental delay. Children need to demonstrate a significant delay in 1 or more areas of development.\nChildren might be suspected of having a motor developmental delay if they are not exploring movement in a variety of ways. Sometimes children who have a motor developmental delay may also have an additional diagnosis, such as hypotonia (low muscle tone) that contributes to their difficulty with movement.\nMotor development in children can often be the first area of delay that is noticed by caregivers. However, in infants and young children, all areas of development are closely connected; a delay in one area can impact progress in another. For example, learning about objects or babbling and talking can be affected if a child does not learn to sit or change positions. Sensory problems, such as hypersensitivity to touch or an inability to plan and problem-solve how to move, may also add to movement difficulties.\nChildren who have some or all of these problems that inhibit their movement development also may develop a fear of trying new motor skills, which can then lead to social or emotional problems.\nParents should first talk to their pediatrician about any concerns they have regarding their child's development. A physician can identify medical problems that may be having an impact on the overall development, such as chronic ear infections that reduce hearing and affect the child's speech development or balance.\nDevelopmental delay is diagnosed by using tests designed to score a child's movement, communication, play, and other behaviors compared with those of other children of the same age. These tests are standardized\u2014scored on hundreds of children\u2014in order to determine a normal range of scores for each age. If children score far below the average score for their age, they are at risk for developmental delay.\nA pediatrician usually will perform a screening test during infancy to determine if a child is progressing at an age-appropriate rate, often at the request of a parent who suspects the child is not performing the same skills as other children of the same age. A screening test helps to identify which children would benefit from a more in-depth evaluation. A physical therapist, who has knowledge of movement development, coordination, and medical conditions, will perform an in-depth examination to determine if a child's motor skills are delayed and, if so, by how much they are delayed.\nYour physical therapist will first evaluate your child, conducting an appropriate and detailed test to determine the child's specific strengths and weaknesses. Your physical therapist will discuss your observations and concerns with you. If the child is diagnosed as having a developmental delay, your physical therapist will problem-sol"</details> | 1024 | C4 | 39081 | 0.4510537176 | 0.9308380484 | 3.2049154692 | 0.6494271866 | A | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

Part II: Starting the Actual Project investigates qualitative and quantitative research designs, methods of data collection, the reliability and validity of data, the sample from the population, and the ethical and legal considerations of engaging in research. Part III: Test, Analyze, Discuss dedicates to the proper collection and analysis of the data. The book also presents an easy guide through the steps needed to be taken when embarking on a research project.\nGo to book: Data-Driven Quality Improvement and Sustainability in Health Care\nData-Driven Quality Improvement and Sustainability in Health Care:\nAn Interprofessional Approach\nIdeas are generated constantly as individuals interact with one another, attend and participate in improvement activities, and experience life. Ideas can remain stagnant or become innovative opportunities that change the future. As ideas are developed, transformation occurs. Prevailing practices and processes are challenged. When challenged, organizations must respond proactively and utilize the talents of others to create pathways to manage impending situations. Data and evidence are the primary drivers in these situations. Understanding and managing data is requisite for organizational change and sustainability in contemporary society. This textbook, originating from an idea, was developed using information from the literature, experiences as educators and managers, and contributions from others in various health and allied disciplines. It provides a snapshot to: improve decision-making; meet consumer demands; develop business cases; influence policy and regulation; understand the value of data collection, analysis, use, and diffusion that will inform quality, safety, and operational efficiency. The textbook's unique attributes include \"real-world\" exemplars and reflection questions for each chapter that demonstrate how data and evidence inform the application of improvement tools, data analysis techniques, and concepts across interprofessional disciplines. The authors anticipate that the information provided will assist improvement teams to improve healthcare processes, guide educators to provide tools and techniques germane to education development, and help students glean knowledge necessary to lead improvement as future healthcare professionals and leaders. The book comprises of 14 chapters. Each of the chapters is central to understanding how data frames quality, safety, innovation, and sustainability in interprofessional practice as consumers become more engaged in their care.\nGo to book: Translation of Evidence Into Nursing and Healthcare\nTranslation of Evidence Into Nursing and Healthcare, 3rd Edition\nThis book intends to serve as an introduction to and a comprehensive resource for the work of translation. Consistent with the first edition, the focus is more precisely on the planning, execution, and achievement of important outcomes rather than the development of the science of implementation. It also intends to encourage and facilitate broad adoption of translation as a means to achieve the Quadruple Aim and to ground the work solidly in theory and evidence. The book can form the scaffold for DNP education and the conduct of the scholarly project. It can also serve as a playbook for DNPs as they begin to practice nursing at the highest level and transform healthcare and the health of society. The third edition presents refreshed and expanded content to describe the work of translation. Examples of successful translation projects are presented to demonstrate the process of working from a problem; through meticulous prosecution of the evidence; to careful planning, execution, evaluation, and finally, broad dissemination. The exemplars demonstrate high-impact, sustainable change that transforms culture and practice. The book is structured into six discrete but compatible sections. Part I contains three chapters that describe the process of translation from a theoretical perspective and reviews the key tenets of evidence-based practice. Part II contains four chapters that describe the application of translation to select practice foci, including outcomes management, safety and quality, leadership, and health policy. Part III contains five chapters that describe a reliable and rigorous approach to the process of translation. Part IV is new to this edition. It presents content to support effective translation. Part V contains two chapters to promote successful translation. Part VI was entirely new in the second edition. It contains three chapters in which examples of successful translation projects are presented.\nGo to book: Population Health for Nurses\nPopulation Health for Nurses:\nImproving Community Outcomes\nEach individual is complex, and, as such, is an integral part of many distinct populations or"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 68659 | 1.129043055 | 0.4939246746 | 3.2049154692 | 1.2893642726 | A | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

Students who see this talk will have a better understanding of the value and limitations of the information that they find, and get practice ideas on where to look for different perspectives.\nThe \"Evaluating Information: The Cornerstone of Civic Online Reasoning\" manual by the Stanford History Education Group helps teachers develop and assess the civic online reasoning capacities of their students. The manual includes ready use to use exercises for students to help them analyse a home page, evaluate evidence, and assess of social media claims. Such skills are essential for students to have in today's digital world.\nThis 10-minute video \"Propaganda Techniques\" by Coronet Instructional Films shows methods of recognizing and evaluating propaganda and encourages the adoption of a judicious, critical attitude toward it. The fact that the video is made in 1949 will make students aware that propaganda is of all ages and the methods for recognizing and evaluation propaganda are still applicable.\nHow Do We Decide What to Believe?\nIn this blog post, Bob Bain, from the Big History Project, introduces four ways that people use to decide what to believe or not: Intuition (gut feeling), authority (relying credibility of source), logic (systematic reasoning) and evidence (verifiable information). The blog post provides a link to a video that explains these claim testers, and questions that can be used by teachers and students alike to question the validity claims. Ultimately, they will notice how the use of evidence and logical reasoning should be valued higher than authority.\nContropedia is an initiative to analyse and visualise controversies within Wikipedia articles. The rationale for this is that the edits of these articles tend to represent conflicts which often reflect larger societal debates, and therefore a good point of enquiry. A demo of the tool, showing the edits of global warming page on Wikipedia, is available. Studying this page will help students better understand how contested some information that is currently visible on Wikipedia can be, and stimulate them to also use the edit history in their research.\nThis series of lessons, produced by the Stanford History Education Group, are designed to support students to develop their historical thinking skills and learn to \"read like a historian\". They are divided in United States History and World History, and organised in units such as American Imperialism and Cold War. The lesson plans and original documents can be downloaded after creating a free account.\nIn this short TED talk, Alisa Miller (Head of Public Radio International) argues that, though we want to know more about the world than ever \u2014 the media is actually showing us less. Using statistics and graphs, she reveals how biased information in the news and on the web is towards national news. Students who watch this video, will better understand the value and limitation of the news as a source of information.\nIn this TED Talk, Patrick Chappatte (a cartoonist who has been published in major international newspapers) talks about power of cartoons. He shares how his work as cartoonist in Hanoi captured the interest of the Vietnamese police, reflects on the 2005 Danish Cartoon controversy, and reflects on the potential for cartoons to be used for good and for bad. Students watching this video will deepen their understanding of how and why cartoons are created and the potential they have to shape public opinion.\nThis webpage, which is part of the book Reporting for the Media (10th edition), by the Oxford University Press, contains several useful information, including students exercises, to learn the basics of news reporting. Many of the topics that are addressed \u2013 Selecting and reporting the news, Ethics, Basic News Leads, Quotation and Attribution \u2013 are also applicable for anyone who wants to present historical information. In this sense journalism and historians are twin disciplines.\nTiki-Toki Online Timeline Maker helps students to present historical information in the form of interactive multi-stranded timelines. Multi-stranded timelines are a good tool to visualise historical developments that are happening in parallel, making it possible \u2013 for example \u2013 to present local and global history side by side. The application is easy to use, both for students and teachers, and with a free account it is possible to create one timeline.\n3D Gallery Builder allows students to design their own virtual exhibition.

Increasing film gauge may necessitate an increase in hot roll temperature in order that the desired interface temperature may be obtained.\nThe ethylene polymers that may be used in the manufacture of film for the co-orientation lamination process may be manufactured by known processes. The polymers may be ethylene homopolymers or copolymers of ethylene and a higher .alpha.-olefin such as ethylene-butene-1 and ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers.\nThe ethylene polymers must be capable of being manufactured into film. Techniques for the manufacture of film from ethylene polymers are known. These techniques include flat film extrusion processes, such as water quench or cold roll quench processes, and blown film processes with or without internal and/or external cooling. The melt index of the ethylene polymers used in film manufacture are preferably less than about 10, this level of melt index not being a critical feature of the invention except for the requirement that the polymers must be capable of being made into film. Similarly, it is preferred that the melt index of the polymer be above about 0.1. Polymer melt index may be obtained using ASTM test method D-1238.\nFor the manufacture of the film of higher melting point, film (A), the preferred ethylene polymers are high density (0.950-0.960) ethylene polymers, especially ethylene homopolymers. For the lower melting point film, film (B), low density (0.910-0.930) ethylene polymers, such as for example, an ethylene-butene-1 copolymer or an ethylene homopolymer, are preferred.\nThe ethylene polymers used in the process of the present invention may contain additives such as stabilizers, fillers such as clays, and pigments such as carbon black, titanium dioxide. The individual films used in the process may be manufactured from ethylene polymers containing different additives.\nIn the process of the present invention, the films to be laminated are brought into contact with each other and with the hot roll of the orientation apparatus. It is an aspect of the present invention that one film, film (A), must be of higher melting point and must be heated to a temperature not exceeding the melting point of the polymer of this film. The co-orientation lamination process may be operated with either type of film, i.e., film (A) or film (B) in contact with the hot roll. It is however, preferred that the film of higher melting point be brought into contact with the hot roll. If film (B) contacts the hot roll, the temperature of the hot roll required to operate the process in the desired manner may be such that the polymer of film (B) melts or becomes soft while in contact with the hot roll which may cause process problems such as adherence of the polymer to the hot roll and/or poor film quality. By contacting the hot roll with film (A), such problems may be avoided.\nThe orientation ratio is preferably at least 1.5 and in particular, 3.0 to 7.0. High orientation ratios may result in process difficulties such as film breakage. Moreover, it is known in the art that the maximum orientation of an ethylene polymer film that may be attained in the absence of significant process difficulties such as film breakage may depend on the method of manufacture of the polymer. Such properties of the ethylene polymer may be a factor in determining the maximum orientation ratio in the process of the present invention.\nThe co-orientation process described herein must be operated with at least one film of each of ethylene polymer film (A) and film (B). In particular, the process may be operated with equal numbers of each film type, especially one of each of films (A) and (B). Under the process conditions of the present invention, operation of the co-orientation process to laminate film combinations in which two films of the higher melting polymer, i.e., two films (A), are brought into contact may result in little or no adhesion between these two films. In an aspect of the invention, film (A) and/or film (B) may be a composite ethylene polymer film such as a high density ethylene polymer film coated"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 54488 | -0.7296065022 | -0.3188528299 | 0.0193967413 | 1.2945670131 | E | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 4 |

| <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>"Virtual World Fandom Quasi-Autoethnography\nThis post contains my reflections on trying to express my Star Wars fandom in Animal Crossing: New Horizons. These reflections are based on the Twitter thread I ran in the summer and fall of 2020, which can be found here. I tried to reconstruct it chronologically to show the progression of events and my thoughts on the experience. I wouldn't call it a full autoethnography, since I haven't really formalized the process, but perhaps it can become something more with additional work.\nJuly 30, 2020: I decided to explore more this idea of fan re/creations in virtual worlds. So I created a sock puppet on the Switch to develop a new Animal Crossing: New Horizon resident that reflects the most impactful fandom in my life: Mara Jade from the first Star Wars expanded universe, as developed by Timothy Zahn (everyone focuses on his creation of Thrawn, but his Mara made such an impact on me growing up, and I told him so when I met him). Going to autoethnographically reflect on the experience.\nI find it interesting to play as her so far because: first, she is just a resident and doesn't have to work, whereas I feel like the \"me\" is the owner and has to work to make the island good; and second, she is definitely a woman but is more adventurous than me, if that makes sense. Like she's more willing to go out and try new things than I am.\nBut now I am thinking I should create a Luke Skywalker puppet and then have them send love notes to each other. Have them live side by side, getting something like domestic bliss which they never got to have. Like an embodied fanfic, where I create an AU to the EU (which I guess is now an AU thanks to Disney?) and give them happiness.\nJuly 31, 2020: With Mara, I feel like she would only want to wear black and green, or have those be her primary colors. For her house, it has to be pretty Spartan, and dark colors, but that she would love to do wood and iron working in her domestic bliss. Once her house is going, then I can start Luke, and I think he wants a comfy house and a lot of greenery and water works around him, given where he grew up. I go back and forth on calling them puppets and skins. I guess it depends on how I see them in the moment.\nAugust 1, 2020: Also finding it interesting to think through their favorite clothes, food, d\u00e9cor. So far I just have Mara running around my island, but what does she like to wear? No skirts, I figure, and a lot of black and green colors, because that's I remember reading her wearing. I figure she would be more Spartan in her d\u00e9cor, more focused on wood and iron, which she likes to build with.\nIndeed, her pastime is more about woodworking and DIY than mine, as I like gardening more. She also doesn't care much about critters, or the other residents. She really likes the idea of a self-reliant lifestyle \u2014 far more than me, as I am trying to get as many creature comforts as I can. And it's weird, because of course this is all coming from me, but she does feel different from me at the same time.\nI also got Luke started now. Set him up by some water. I figure he'd really be into water, fishing, swimming, and growing things. And just plain exploring. He also has to be nice to everyone and try to help them whenever he can.\nAnd it is so much harder shopping for him! I don't think he would be extravagant and would like low-key, comfy furniture and clothing. And red and black clothing, I feel. But I have no idea! I have never seen him clad in colors, and he seems as Spartan as Mara, but more fun?\nAugust 2, 2020: It also feels weird to receive packages from Mother. Mara was taken from her parents, and Luke's mom, well\u2026\nI think Luke's appearance turned out very well, and I like Mara's except for her eyes. I don't know how to capture her eyes, whereas I have a lot of experience with Luke's eyes\u2026and staring into them dreamily\u2026\nOkay, I got Mara's eyes better now, and Luke"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 60586 | 0.6277418479 | -0.3987036732 | 0.0193967413 | -0.6200415043 | F | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

He wasn't an angry person, just very intense, but it worked out the same way \u2013 I didn't think anyone would try to find out what would happen to fidgetters.\n\n\"When you've mastered the skills we teach here, you should be able to project your own energy in ways you can use to defend yourself.\" He began. \"Like this.\"\n\nHe spun and slashed out at one of the straw dummies. It sliced in half along the diagonal as if cut by a sword.\n\n\"Or this.\" He spun the other way and pushed a palm towards the dummy on the other end of the line. It shuddered visibly as if shoulder-charged by someone big.\n\n\"Or.\" He did some gesture and a ball of flame shot from his hand and covered the dummy. He turned back to us, opened his mouth as if to speak and then turned back to the dummy, blew at it as you would a candle and put the flames out.\n\nThe cohort was gobsmacked; mouths hanging open all around. For myself, well, I've seen Kunetsuka Sensei do things that impressed me as much without having a quantum computer to put in the special effects.\n\n\"Now, before you reach that stage, you'll find it useful if you've some object that allows you to focus and direct energies through. The traditional wizard's wand is one you'll practice with. Later.\"\n\nHe drew one from his sleeve. \"Its chief advantage is it's light, which is important if you're going to carry it all day, and easily hidden. Make no mistake though \u2013 it's not a magical thing in its own right. The power comes from you. I've seen young Mages use twigs they plucked from trees as wands. So long as you don't try to use Rowan wood, and so long as you can think of it as a focus, anything wooden'll work. Mind, I'd leave your mam's rolling pin at home or she'll likely clip your ear for you.\"\n\nThere were a few laughs, but I think they were being kind.\n\n\"The chief disadvantage, for you, at present, is it's just a small piece of wood. You can't yet do this...\""</details> | 1024 | Book | 76659 | 0.6523960057 | -0.5321055025 | 0.0193967413 | -0.6876771313 | O | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Lynch\nDec 12 2019 02:20 Gmt+3\nLast Updated On: Dec 14 2019 11:28 Gmt+3\nAfter months of strained relations with Turkey, U.S. lawmakers moved forward on two pieces of legislation this week that would punish Turkey for purchasing S-400 missile systems from Russia.\n\"U.S. officials are privately and publicly warning that the failure to resolve the S-400 issue is leading the U.S. inexorably to impose sanctions on Turkey,\" Jonathan Schanzer, senior vice president at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, told Ahval.\nOn Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee passed the Promoting American National Security and Preventing the Resurgence of ISIS Act introduced by its chairman, Republican Senator Jim Risch, and ranking member, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, with a bipartisan 18-to-4 vote.\n\"Now's the time for the Senate to come together and take this opportunity to change Turkey's behaviour,\" Risch said.\nThe Risch-Menendez bill requires the White House to implement sanctions against Turkey for the purchase of Russian S-400s under the 2017 Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) and further mandates targeted sanctions in response to Turkish military operations in Syria.\nThe House passed a similar sanctions bill in October by a veto-proof margin of 403-to-16.\nThe bill, \"in combo with CAATSA, means no congressional sign off on weapons exports to Turkey,\" said Aaron Stein, the director of the Middle East programme at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. \"So it is, de facto, an embargo.\"\nSenator's Ted Cruz's no vote against the bill in committee was notable given his fierce criticism of the Trump administration last week for failing to implement mandatory CAATSA sanctions on Russia.\nThe sole Democrat to vote against the bill, Senator Tom Udall, said he was concerned about the long-term implications of sanctioning a NATO ally and wanted an amendment that would require President Donald Trump to divest from his business interests in Turkey.\nThe final version of the National Defense Authorization Act for 2020 (NDAA), which required months of negotiation, also addresses the S-400 issue. The House passed the defence bill on Wednesday evening and Trump said he would sign it immediately after the Senate vote.\nThe NDAA includes a Sense of Congress that Turkey's S-400 purchase is a significant transaction under CAATSA and says the President should implement sanctions under that Act.\n\"The sanctions would be imposed on the Turkish persons engaged in accepting the S-400s,\" said Peter Harrell, a sanctions expert at the Center for New American Security. \"Presumably, this might mean some senior Turkish military officers involved in the S-400 acquisition and maybe some subsidiary part of the Turkish military.\"\nThe United States suspended Turkey from the programme to build F-35s in July when it took delivery of the first S-400 components due to concerns that this would allow Russia to gather data on the advanced fighter jets.\nNate Schenkkan, the director of special research at Freedom House, argued it was time to accept that Turkey was giving up on full NATO membership. There is no mechanism to eject a member state, but Schenkkan said there were ways to compartmentalise Turkey within the alliance. He recommended the United States fully remove Turkey from the F-35 programme as punishment for the S-400 delivery.\nGuided by the official summary of the NDAA, it has been widely reported that the bill prohibits the transfer of F-35 stealth fighter jets to Turkey. However, the full text of the NDAA outlines a continuation of the current suspension, not a complete removal.\nAlthough the F-35 measure in the NDAA falls short of Schenkkan's recommendation, he said: \"It still is a strong message. It seems like Congress is on board with removal from the programme, so it's just a matter of how they get there over time.\"\nWhile Schenkkan is glad the NDAA also asks the president to implement CAAT"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 23156 | 0.1302072484 | 0.69537039 | 0.0191292471 | 0.4621285273 | I | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 2 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

The pressure on labs would be mammoth and the yield is likely low,\" she said on Instagram.\nDr Alexander said patients needed to have either a history of international travel or to have been in close contact with a confirmed case.\n\"The patient also needs symptoms consistent with the virus such as fever or cough. These are the current GP guidelines for testing in Australia,\" she said.\nA total 126 cases of coronavirus have now been confirmed across Australia, with 64 in New South Wales, 18 in Victoria, 17 in Queensland, 8 in South Australia, 7 in Western Australia and 2 in Tasmania.\nFrydenberg grilled on 7.30\nAlle McMahon\nTreasurer Josh Frydenberg took a beating on 7.30 last night, as host Leigh Sales grilled him about the now wiped out budget surplus.\n\"Last year you were claiming credit for a surplus that you had not yet delivered, saying the Budget was back in black,\" Sales said.\n\"You were warned global events could derail that prospect, which they now have. What does your premature rush to claim credit for a phantom surplus say about your political maturity and judgement?\"\n\"Well, we took the best possible advice and based on the forecasts at the time and we have delivered a balanced Budget,\" Mr Frydenberg replied.\n\"As for a surplus, we've made it very clear and the PM made it very clear today we have now taken these major spending decisions and surplus won't arrive in 19-20 as a result of some of these circumstances we've seen.\"\nBut Sales then reminded Mr Frydenberg that last year he was insistent the surplus would be safe in the event of a national or global crisis.\n\"I want to play our audience something from around the time of the Budget last year,\" Sales said, rolling footage from his interview on April 2.\n\"Like any projection, your ability to deliver that $7 billion surplus is reliant on factors that are outside your control. It might not happen,\" Sales had warned.\n\"No, it will happen. And it's the product of bringing the spending under control,\" Frydenberg had promised.\nIn another interview on Sky News, David Speers had cautioned: \"There might be a collapse in China or a terrible drought, write down the NBN. Things can happen that could prevent you actually achieving this?\"\nBut again Mr Frydenberg was clear: \"There's not a wafer-thin surplus. This is a very significant surplus\".\nResponding to the footage, Mr Frydenberg said: \"Well, we maintain those were the forecasts at the time \u2026 What we could not foresee and what you couldn't foresee and what the global economy couldn't foresee was this one-in-a-century event, the spread of the coronavirus which is putting the shutters up on the global economy.\"\n2h agoMarch 13, 2020\nWilkinson describes feeling in America\nAustralian television host Lisa Wilkinson says America \"feels like it's shutting down\" as the country steps up its response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\"I don't know how much longer these borders are going to be open,\" she said on Instagram on Thursday.\n\"Australia, here I come\u2026 Be safe everyone. Wash your hands. And look after each other.\nWilkinson said she was in the United States for a \"major celeb interview\" set to air on The Project.\nMore than 1,300 cases of the COVID-19 disease have been confirmed across the US and 38 people have died.\n2h agoMarch 13, 2020HIGHLIGHT\nWhy are only some people being tested?\nDr Preeya Alexander, also known as The Wholesome Doctor on Instagram, has explained why only some people are being tested for the coronavirus despite GPs"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 2818 | -0.0918513806 | -0.1760502005 | 0.018762681 | -0.5941903873 | A | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 3 |

Are people becoming aware of the 'new' philosophy of German football, its clubs and players?\nThree card trick\nRH: I think what has happened in the past was that people outside Germany used to conflate the German national team with the Bundesliga and thought it's all the same. There's also the traditional problem that Germany as a country has looked less exotic or current than Italy or England. But I'd say perceptions have really changed since 2006. 2010 was a great year with Germany playing good stuff and Bayern reaching the Champions League final. There's much more attention on it now. And with attention comes knowledge and a better understanding of its strengths and weaknesses.\nBF: Mesut Ozil has emerged as the best German player at the moment, although for a long time the talents\nof Toni Kroos overshadowed him. Their careers now seem to have gone in conflicting directions, for while Ozil has gone from strength to strength Kroos has gone slightly off the boil. What do you think the future holds for these two players?\nRH: I'm not sure it's right to say that Kroos started out the bigger prospect. \u00d6zil is a year older and had his breakthrough domestically much earlier while Kroos was given little playing time at Bayern and turned into a different player on loan at Leverkusen. \u00d6zil will hopefully continue to develop off and on the pitch. As for Kroos, I think he might benefit from Bastian Schweinsteiger's experiences and turn into a proper central midfielder. The two of them combined well together at the end of year, before Kroos picked up an injury.\nNow on to lighter stuff\u2026.\nBF: The Guardian is perhaps the best resource for football news in the world. So many great writers, sometimes you are spoilt for choice. So of all other things, who is the joker in the pack? It's Sid Lowe isn't it?\nRH: They're all pretty funny guys, it has to be said. I think James Richardson is the funniest, personally. Sid's the best writer though.\nBF: Is there anything better than being able to make your passion your job. Assuming of course football is your passion.\nRH: Of course it is my passion! And the answer to question is no. I feel very blessed.\nBF: Any advice for up and coming journalists?\nRH: 1. Find a niche and fill it and 2. Be very clear about the kind of money you can earn in the medium term and decide whether that's enough for the lifestyle you want.\nQuickfire:\nYour favourite player of all time: Karl-Heinz Rummenigge\nYour favourite currently active player: Lionel Messi\nMost underrated Bundesliga player: Arturo Vidal\nMost overrated Bundesliga player: Marko Arnautovic\nMagath, Tuchel or Klopp? Klopp\nBF: Last but definitely not the least. Who do you support?

| <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>"$d$-dimensional ghost-free massive gravity can be obtained by a discrete dimensional reduction (a \\textit{dimensional deconstruction}) of Einstein gravity in $d+1$-dimensions. In \\cite{Ondo:2016cdv}, this approach was extended to linearized supersymmetric massive gravity, obtaining the free $\\mathcal{N}=1$ massive graviton in $4d$ from the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ massive graviton in $5d$. Whether this approach remains viable and preserves the requisite (half) of the original supercharges in the presence of interactions remains unknown. A possible path to constructing the fully non-linear $10d$ $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ massive gravity model (and subsequently the $4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=4$ model) is as a dimensional deconstruction of massless $11d$ supergravity. \n\n\\vspace{3mm}\n\\noindent\\textbf{Higher-multiplicity}\n\n\\vspace{3mm}\n\\noindent The analysis in this paper is restricted to cubic interactions. The extension to higher-multiplicity is conceptually straightforward, although technically more challenging. At 4-point there are infinitely many non-redundant local operators that may appear in an effective action, and so the corresponding superspace analysis should be carried out order-by-order in a consistent derivative expansion. There is the additional complication that non-local contributions from tree-level Feynman diagrams can mix with local contact contributions, and so these should also be included in the construction of a 4-point superamplitude ansatz. In such a calculation the empirically observed maximally improved high-energy growth of ghost-free interactions may be an important organizing principle \\cite{Schwartz:2003vj,Cheung:2016yqr,Bonifacio:2018vzv,Falkowski:2020mjq}. \n\nIt should be noted that using the supersymmetric cubic amplitudes presented in Section \\ref{sec:susy3point}, we can construct $n$-point amplitudes that are compatible with supersymmetry by gluing together 3-point amplitudes on poles. This procedure is ambiguous up to $n$-point supersymmetric contact terms. Such $n$-point amplitudes will correspond to a theory with the correct particle content and appropriately chosen supersymmetric ``contact'' contributions. Starting with the 3-point amplitude of a ghost-free theory $b_1 \\mathcal{B}1 + b_2\\mathcal{B}2$ however, does not guarantee that $n$-point amplitudes constructed in this way will also be ghost-free. For this, the pole terms may not be enough and contact contributions may have to be added. This entails a full higher-point analysis, which is more involved as discussed above.\n\nAlternatively, as for massless supergravity, it might be possible to construct higher-multiplicity tree-level scattering amplitudes using a superspace \\textit{on-shell recursion} \\cite{Britto:2005fq,Drummond:2008cr}. BCFW-inspired recursion for massive states was described in \\cite{Badger:2005zh,Schwinn:2007ee} and extended to massive on-shell superspace in \\cite{Boels:2011zz,Herderschee:2019dmc}. There is the usual difficulty that establishing recursion relations requires exceptional high-energy growth for large complex momenta \\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2008bsc}. Since, as discussed above, the dRGT model is uniquely characterized by its high-energy growth for physical momenta, it would be interesting to try and construct a complex momentum shift that exploits this. It is possible that an on-shell recursion relation \\textit{only} exists for the supersymmetric model, or a consistent truncation thereof. For example, for massless Yang-Mills coupled to a massless complex (adjoint) scalar, BCFW recursion is possible only if a specifically tuned quartic scalar potential term is added to the minimal Lagrangian \\cite{Elvang:2013cua}. The value of this coupling is precisely the value required for this model to be obtained as a consistent truncation of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ super Yang-Mills. It would be interesting to see if an analogous connection between on-shell constructability and supersymmetry exists for massive"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 42661 | 0.6989649702 | 0.8305628479 | 0.891863654 | 3.1675536063 | G | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

In this form we can see the power and utility of the massive spinor formalism \\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2017jhn}. The massive spinors give a uniform (and manifestly covariant) language in which we can relate bosons and fermions in different $SU(2){\\text{LG}}$ representations. Similar one-particle representations exist for the $\\mathcal{N}>1$ supersymmetric graviton multiplets, these can be most efficiently expressed in the language of on-shell superfields and will be described in detail in the following subsection.\n\nWhen interactions are introduced, the off-shell supersymmetry transformations of the field operators will be modified (after integrating out possible auxiliary fields), but the action of the supercharges on on-shell asymptotic states (\\ref{N=1oneparticlesusyrep}) will not. In a given supersymmetric model, the S-matrix operator commutes with the supercharges ($[Q\\alpha,S]=[Q^\\dagger_{\\dot{\\alpha}},S]=0$), and if furthermore the supersymmetry is not spontaneously broken ($Q_\\alpha0\\rangle = Q_{\\dot{\\alpha}}0\\rangle = 0$), then the associated S-matrix elements must satisfy a set of linear relations called \\textit{on-shell} supersymmetry Ward identities (SWI) \\cite{Grisaru:1976vm, Grisaru:1977px}. \n\nAs an explicit example, using (\\ref{N=1oneparticlesusyrep}) we can deduce the SWI satisfied by three-particle amplitudes in $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric massive gravity.

For instance, the decoupling of the Boulware-Deser ghost was first proven in this limit \\cite{deRham:2010ik} and only later extended to full massive gravity \\cite{Hassan:2011hr}. We expect similar logic to apply to the problem of analyzing the constraints of supersymmetry. If the high-energy limit of an interaction term is inconsistent with $\\mathcal{N}$-extended supersymmetry, then this operator cannot be consistent with $\\mathcal{N}$-supersymmetry at any scale\\footnote{This argument is purely based on a simplification due to special kinematics. It does not require that the decoupling limit model is a consistent limit of an underlying UV completion. Indeed there are various arguments indicating that new states and interactions must appear before the strictly massless high-energy limit is reached \\cite{Tolley:2020gtv}. The converse of this argument is also obviously invalid, consistency with supersymmetry in the high-energy limit is not sufficient to guarantee supersymmetry at low-energies where the masses are important.}. \n\nThe precise form of the constraints of supersymmetry on the high-energy interactions depends on which supermultiplets the massless states belong to. Since the resulting massless limits of the massive graviton supermultiplets contain many helicity $0$ and helicity $1$ states across massless multiplets of varying superspin, identifying which of these are the vector and Galileon modes is a non-trivial problem. As we explain in the following subsection, in some cases this can be determined by careful bookkeeping of R-symmetry representations and CPT in the massless limit. \n\n\\subsection{Massless Limit of Massive Supermultiplets}\n\\label{sec:masslesslimitmultiplets}\n\nIn the high-energy limit, massive supermultiplets effectively break-up into massless multiplets, usually with superspin degeneracies. As a consequence, the high-energy limit may admit additional global symmetries not present at low-energies. All statements about the high-energy limit in this section should be understood as approximate statements, valid at leading order in a $1/m$ expansion. The presence of global symmetries makes the definition of R-symmetry in the massless limit ambiguous since we are always free to form arbitrary linear combinations of R- and global symmetry generators. These emergent global symmetries and their relation to the low-energy or \\textit{massive} R-symmetry are a useful organizing principle for understanding the dynamics of the high-energy limit. \n\nOur main application of these global symmetries will be to identify the massless supermultiplets containing the Galileon and vector modes of the original massive graviton. To do this we make use of the fact that these modes have the same quantum numbers as the graviton, i.e. they are in the $\\mathbf{1}0$ representation of the massive R-symmetry group $SU(\\mathcal{N})R\\times U(1)R$ and are CPT even. In some cases we will see that this is enough to uniquely identify the states.\n\nThe general approach we take is to begin with the action of the \\textit{naive} massless R-symmetry group $SU(\\mathcal{N})R^{m=0} \\times U(1)R^{m=0}$ appropriate for an isolated massless supermultiplet (and its CPT conjugate). The $U(1)R^{m=0}$ charge is chosen to be $0$ for the highest helicity state of a positive helicity multiplet, $-1$ for the next-to-highest and so on. The quantum numbers of the negative helicity multiplets are fixed by CPT. For CPT self-conjugate multiplets, such as the $\\mathcal{N}=4$ vector multiplet, the $U(1)R^{m=0}$ charge of the highest helicity state is chosen to be $\\mathcal{N}/2$ and for the lowest helicity state $-\\mathcal{N}/2$. Our goal is to identify a global symmetry $SU(\\mathcal{N}){\\text{global}}\\times U(1){\\text{global}}$ such that the massive R-symmetry group is the diagonal subgroup\n\\begin{equation}    \n\\label{diagonal}\n    SU(\\mathcal{N})R^{m=0} \\times U(1)R^{m=0} \\times SU(\\mathcal{N}){\\text{global}}\\times U("</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 42661 | 1.0249477224 | 1.1260165638 | 1.3078071822 | 3.0426878334 | O | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

Phenomena of interest that can usually only be understood qualitatively, can -- for supersymmetric models -- often be brought under quantitative control. Even if the ultimate goal is to analyze the physics of a non-supersymmetric model, it is therefore often useful to first construct and study a closely related supersymmetric version.  \n\nThis strategy has been extremely profitable for understanding the dynamics of gauge theories \\cite{Brink:1976bc,DHoker:1999yni} and gravity \\cite{Freedman:1976xh,Deser:1976eh,Freedman:2012zz}. A general lesson is that models with \\textit{maximal} supersymmetry\\footnote{In this paper, all models are in $d=4$ (unless otherwise specified) with the associated counting of supersymmetries, \\textit{e.g.} 16 supercharges corresponds to $\\mathcal{N}=4$. }, such as $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills and $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity, are the most solvable, but also the most rigid. Even though the field content of these models is often vast ($4d$ $\\mathcal{N}=8$ supergravity has $256$ propagating degrees of freedom compared to $2$ for non-supersymmetric Einstein gravity), the symmetry is so constraining that the particle spectrum is completely determined on general grounds and the number of free parameters in the Lagrangian remains small. Given the many remarkable properties of these models, some of which are apparent only in on-shell observables like the S-matrix, a strong case has been made that these are in some sense the \\textit{simplest} quantum field theories \\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2008owk}.\n\nInspired by this success, it is natural to suppose that supersymmetry may be an equally powerful tool for analyzing models of massive higher-spin states. As a concrete example, in this paper we initiate a systematic study of the possible supersymmetrizations of models of an isolated,  self-interacting massive spin-2 particle in $4d$ Minkowski spacetime, a \\textit{massive graviton}. Previous studies of supersymmetric massive gravity include \\cite{Gregoire:2004ic, Malaeb:2013lia,Malaeb:2013nra,Ondo:2016cdv,DelMonte:2016czb,Ferrara:2018iko}. The study of massive spin-2 field theories has a very long history, beginning with the discovery of physical wave equations and an associated action principle by Fierz and Pauli \\cite{Fierz:1939ix}. The proposed interpretation of these models as a long-distance modification of general relativity is briefly reviewed in Section \\ref{dRGTreview}. \n\nIn spite of the impressive scope of the literature on massive gravitons, many things remain unknown. Models of isolated massive higher-spin states are usually constructed as low-energy effective field theories (EFT) valid below some finite strong-coupling scale. The general problem of constructing UV completions of these EFTs satisfying the usual properties of locality, causality and unitarity remains unsolved. For the converse problem of demarcating the boundaries of the swampland (the space of otherwise healthy EFTs with no UV completion), various model-independent, bottom-up approaches have been pursued including: constraints from S-matrix positivity \\cite{Alberte:2019xfh}, the absence of asymptotic superluminality \\cite{Hinterbichler:2017qyt} and bounds on raising the strong coupling scale by tuning self-interactions \\cite{Bonifacio:2018vzv,Bonifacio:2019mgk}. From the top-down, the open problem of constructing explicit, asymptotically Minkowski string vacua with a gap in the spin-2 spectrum (or proving a no-go theorem that such a construction is impossible\\footnote{For example, see \\cite{Klaewer:2018yxi} for recently proposed swampland criteria for massive spin-2 states.}) may be more tractable"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 42661 | 1.3755846322 | 1.3014981648 | 1.5969386591 | 3.0114713902 | O | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

By contrast, for asymptotically AdS spacetimes, in which a weak-coupling spin-2 Higgs mechanism is possible \\cite{Karch:2000ct,Karch:2001cw,Porrati:2001gx,Porrati:2003sa,Aharony:2003qf,Duff:2004wh,Aharony:2006hz,deRham:2006pe,Kiritsis:2008at,Apolo:2012gg,Gabadadze:2014rwa,Gabadadze:2015goa,Domokos:2015xka,Gabadadze:2017jom,Bachas:2018zmb}, explicit string vacua with a spin-2 gap are known \\cite{Karch:2000ct,Karch:2001cw,Bachas:2018zmb}.\n\nWe are also motivated by the prospect of discovering hidden structures or symmetries in non-supersymmetric models of massive gravity. Even though a supersymmetric model necessarily requires an equal number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom, when constructing solutions to the classical equations of motion (or calculating tree-level scattering amplitudes) it is always a consistent truncation to set the fermions to zero. There may be further possible truncations depending on the global symmetries of the model. As a consequence, supersymmetric arguments can play an important role in the classical dynamics of non-supersymmetric models\\footnote{We remind the reader of two classic examples. $(i)$ The extremal Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solution of the Einstein-Maxwell model admits Killing spinors, a remnant of its allowed embedding as a BPS solution of pure $\\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity. $(ii)$ The \\textit{tree-level} (color-ordered) gluon amplitudes of pure Yang-Mills theory satisfy $A_n[+,+,...,+,+] = A_n[+,+,...,+,-]=0$ since these helicity sectors necessarily vanish in supersymmetric Yang-Mills as a consequence of the on-shell supersymmetry Ward identities. }. These hidden structures may only remain in bosonic models with special particle content and tunings of interactions. By constructing the most general \\textit{supersymmetrizations} of the self-interactions of a massive graviton we may hope to discover such special tunings. \n\nThe problem of constraining the dynamics of any model with arbitrarily extended supersymmetry is highly non-trivial; the additional difficulty of constructing models of interacting massive higher-spin states makes this problem essentially intractable with presently available tools. There is no known formalism that allows for the construction of generic models with the following properties simultaneously: $(i)$ manifest $\\mathcal{N}\\geq 4$ supersymmetry, $(ii)$ manifest Lorentz invariance and $(iii)$ a realization of the supersymmetry algebra that closes off-shell. We note that for $\\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetry, the off-shell superfields corresponding to a massive graviton multiplet have been constructed \\cite{Buchbinder:2002gh, Zinoviev:2018eok, Zinoviev:2002xn,Gates:2013tka}. One could imagine constructing the models presented in this paper using a version of harmonic superspace \\cite{Galperin:2001seg}, with some of the supersymmetry non-manifest; we will not pursue this direction. Instead, we take inspiration from the success of the on-shell \\textit{scattering amplitudes} program \\cite{Elvang:2009wd}, and by-pass the construction of an off-shell effective action in favor of the on-shell (tree-level) S-matrix elements. Here we have many powerful tools at our disposal, especially a massive version of the spinor-helicity formalism \\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2017jhn}, and a recently developed, manifestly Lorentz-covariant \\textit{on-shell superspace} \\cite{Herderschee:2019ofc}.

This can be seen in the above examples, the component states of the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ massive graviton multiplet can be assigned the $U(1)R$ charges given in Table \\ref{tab:N1multiplet}. The SWI (\\ref{WIexampleeval1}) relates amplitudes which conserve $U(1)R$-charge, while (\\ref{WIexampleeval2}) relates amplitudes which each violate conservation of $U(1)R$-charge by $-1$ units. \n\nFor general $\\mathcal{N}$, the unique highest spin state in the multiplet is the massive graviton and is therefore necessarily an R-singlet. The supersymmetry constraints on the cubic graviton interactions then arise only from R-singlet SWI. \nWithout loss of generality, the problem of understanding the constraints of supersymmetry on scattering amplitudes at lowest multiplicity (cubic interactions) is therefore reduced to solving the SWIs in the R-singlet sector. As we will explain in the following subsections this problem can be essentially trivialized, even for arbitrarily extended supersymmetry, by rephrasing it in the language of on-shell superspace.\n\n\n\n\\subsection{Massive Graviton On-Shell Superfields}\n\\label{sec:onshellsuperfields}\nThe idea of an \\textit{on-shell} superspace as a framework for making manifest arbitrarily extended supersymmetry for scattering amplitudes was introduced in \\cite{Nair:1988bq}, see also \\cite{Witten:2003nn}. The extension of these methods to massive supermultiplets was made in a non-covariant form in \\cite{Boels:2011zz} and most recently in a fully Lorentz-covariant form in $4d$ \\cite{Herderschee:2019ofc,Herderschee:2019dmc} based on the massive spinor formalism \\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2017jhn}. Below we review the essential elements of massive on-shell superspace based on \\cite{Herderschee:2019ofc,Herderschee:2019dmc}.\n\nWe define massive on-shell superspace by extending the field over which we form linear combinations in the asymptotic one-particle Hilbert space by an $SU(2){\\text{LG}}$ doublet of anti-commuting c-number (Grassmann) valued parameters $\\eta^I$. In this extended Hilbert space, we can form special linear combinations of the one-particle states comprising complete supersymmetry multiplets called \\textit{on-shell superfields}. For example, for the $\\mathcal{N}=1$ massive gravity multiplet we construct the massive graviton superfield\n\\begin{equation}\n    \\label{N=1mgravitonsuperfield}\n    \\Psi^{IJK}(\\vec{p},\\eta)\\rangle \\equiv \\psi^{IJK}(\\vec{p})\\rangle+\\frac{1}{4\\sqrt{3}}\\eta^{(I}\\gamma^{JK)}(\\vec{p})\\rangle+\\eta_Lh^{IJKL}(\\vec{p})\\rangle+\\frac{1}{2}\\eta_L\\eta^L\\tilde{\\psi}^{IJK}(\\vec{p})\\rangle.\n\\end{equation}\nThe one-particle states or \\textit{component fields} can be extracted from the superfield by acting with appropriate Grassmann differential projection operators, for example to project out the graviton \n\\begin{align}\n\\label{projection}\n    h^{IJKL}(\\vec{p})\\rangle  \\equiv \\frac{1}{4}\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\eta{(L}}\\Psi^{IJK)}(\\vec{p},\\eta)\\rangle \\biggr\\vert{\\eta=0}.\n\\end{align}\nTo avoid clutter, it is conventional to use the simplified notation for states $X^{I_1...I_s}(\\vec{p},\\eta)\\rangle\\sim X^{I_1...I_s}$, which we will follow for the rest of the paper.

The holomorphic cotangent bundle is the dual of the holomorphic tangent bundle, and is written . Similarly the anti-holomorphic cotangent bundle is the dual of the anti-holomorphic tangent bundle, and is written . The holomorphic and anti-holomorphic (co)tangent bundles are interchanged by conjugation, which gives a real-linear (but not complex linear!) isomorphism .\n\nThe holomorphic tangent bundle  is isomorphic as a real vector bundle of rank  to the regular tangent bundle . The isomorphism is given by the composition  of inclusion into the complexified tangent bundle, and then projection onto the -eigenbundle.\n\nThe canonical bundle is defined by .\n\nAlternative local description\nIn a local holomorphic chart  of , one has distinguished real coordinates  defined by  for each . These give distinguished complex-valued one-forms  on . Dual to these complex-valued one-forms are the complex-valued vector fields (that is, sections of the complexified tangent bundle),\n\nTaken together, these vector fields form a frame for , the restriction of the complexified tangent bundle to . As such, these vector fields also split the complexified tangent bundle into two subbundles\n\nUnder a holomorphic change of coordinates, these two subbundles of  are preserved, and so by covering  by holomorphic charts one obtains a splitting of the complexified tangent bundle. This is precisely the splitting into the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic tangent bundles previously described. Similarly the complex-valued one-forms  and  provide the splitting of the complexified cotangent bundle into the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic cotangent bundles.\n\nFrom this perspective, the name holomorphic tangent bundle becomes transparent. Namely, the transition functions for the holomorphic tangent bundle, with local frames generated by the , are given by the Jacobian matrix of the transition functions of . Explicitly, if we have two charts  with two sets of coordinates , then \n\nSince the coordinate functions are holomorphic, so are any derivatives of them, and so the transition functions of the holomorphic tangent bundle are also holomorphic. Thus the holomorphic tangent bundle is a genuine holomorphic vector bundle. Similarly the holomorphic cotangent bundle is a genuine holomorphic vector bundle, with transition functions given by the inverse transpose of the Jacobian matrix. Notice that the anti-holomorphic tangent and cotangent bundles do not have holomorphic transition functions, but anti-holomorphic ones.\n\nIn terms of the local frames described, the almost-complex structure  acts by\n\nor in real coordinates by\n\nHolomorphic vector fields and differential forms\nSince the holomorphic tangent and cotangent bundles have the structure of holomorphic vector bundles, there are distinguished holomorphic sections.

The functional integral reduces to the integral of one-loop determinants over the space of the critical points of the $\\delta\\epsilon$-exact term.

In particular the explicit physical realization of this is that every operator contains an integer power of a scalar field $\\phi$, the last component of the gravitational multiplet, whose value defines the so called gravitational degree;  in the moduli space integral this corresponds to the power of the two dimensional differential form $\\alpha$ associated to the scalar $\\phi$. Carefully evaluating the zeros of a section representing one of the $\\alpha$'s, and if these have support only on the boundary of the moduli space of the Riemann surface, allows us to express a correlation function in terms of correlation functions containing a lower total gravitational degree and with genus lower or equal to the original one. The result are called topological recursion relations.\n\nIndeed it is known that the holomorphic limit of the A model correlation functions basically obeys the Witten's abstract definition of topological gravity coupled to a two dimensional sigma model, \\cite{Bershadsky:1993ta}. Moreover it computes Gromov-Witten invariants,  and these satisfy topological recursion relations. However A and B  topological string models are physically a different story from the theories considered by Witten: the target space is fixed to be a Calabi Yau threefold, in which case the gravitational multiplet scalar $\\phi$ simply decouples ( with the only exception of the dilaton ). The coupling to two dimensional gravity comes instead from the analogy with the bosonic string theory construction of the gauge fixed path integral, and correlation functions are defined to contain a copy of the left and right moving twisted spin two supercurrents $G^-, \\bar{G}^-$ for each of the moduli of the Riemann surface $\\Sigma{g,n}$ \\footnote{genus $g$ and $n$ operator insertions}.\n\nThis way of defining topological string amplitudes led the authors of \\cite{Bershadsky:1993cx} to the derivation of a different set of recursion relations expressing the antiholomorphic target space moduli derivative of correlation functions in terms of covariant holomorphic derivatives of amplitudes with either a lower genus or a lower number of operator insertions, or both. \nThese relations are known as the holomorphic anomaly equation ( H.A.E. for short ). \n\nIt is thus a natural question if it exists or not a formalism able to provide a direct connection between the topological recursion relations and the H.A.E. To my knowledge a similar issue was investigated so far only in \\cite{Gomez:1994qk}, where the tt* equations  were derived from consistency conditions over an enlarged set of operator contact term algebra containing also the antiholomorphic sector, and the H.A.E. was obtained from the recursion relations written by Verlinde and Verlinde in \\cite{Verlinde:1990ku} . Their assumptions, development and results are however quite different from the present discussion.\n\nThe strategy of the work will be simple. We want to formally apply the Witten's recursion relations machinery to  topological string theory correlation functions by roughly looking at $G^-, \\bar{G}^-$ as a substitute of the field $\\phi$. In fact we will see that these objects are, for certain properties, the analogue of what $\\phi$ is for the gravitational descendants. This will lead to the definition of an operator ${\\cal{W}}s$ acting on correlation functions and producing what would have been the right hand side of the topological recursion relations if $\\phi$ had been replaced by $G^-, \\bar{G}^-$. The result will be that, imposing a certain commutator between ${\\cal{W}}s$ and the flat antiholomorphic derivative $\\bar{\\nabla}{\\bar{i}}$ ( from the tt* equations of \\cite{Cecotti:1991me} ), is equivalent to the  H.A.E. In fact the full algebra we will consider is a generalization of the tt* equations and reads:\n\n\\[\n[{\\cal{W}}s,\\bar{\\nabla}{\\bar{i}}] = \\bar{\\nabla}{\\bar{i}} \n\\]\n\\[\n[{\\cal{W}}s,\\nabla{i}] = 0\n\\]\n\\[\n[\\nabla{i},\\bar{\\nabla}{\\bar"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 55686 | 0.8318234869 | 0.7625189618 | 0.8969361361 | 2.9490385037 | G | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

Such models contain massless spin-2 KK zero-modes corresponding to $4d$ massless gravitons. Ignoring this, even the non-zero KK modes violate assumption (iii) since they always appear in pairs of left-moving and right-moving states. Furthermore, these massive KK modes are charged under the emergent $U(1)$ gauge field, the \\textit{graviphoton}, violating assumption (i) and making cubic self-interactions impossible. \n\nOn-shell supermultiplets are constructed by choosing a Clifford vacuum, defined as a spin-$s$ (sometimes called \\textit{superspin}) multiplet of one-particle states satisfying\n\\begin{align}\n    Q{a\\dot{\\alpha}}^\\dagger \\Omega^{I_1...I{2s}}\\rangle = 0\\,,\n\\end{align}\nwhere $a=1,2,...,\\mathcal{N}$ is an R-symmetry index and $I_i=1,2$ is an index of the massive little group $SU(2){\\text{LG}}$. Following \\cite{Arkani-Hamed:2017jhn} we denote a spin-$s$ multiplet as a totally symmetric rank-$2s$ tensor of $SU(2){\\text{LG}}$. Acting on $\\Omega^{I_1...I_{2s}}\\rangle$ with the other supercharges $Q^a_\\alpha$ in all possible ways generates the remaining states in the supermultiplet. Note that unlike in the case of massless supersymmetry, the Clifford vacuum is not necessarily the state in the multiplet with the lowest spin. \n\nThe massive supermultiplets satisfying conditions (i)-(iii) were constructed some time ago \\cite{Ferrara:1980ra,Ferrara:1981ep}. The results are summarized in Table \\ref{tab:reptable} together with a decomposition of the component states into irreducible representations of the maximal R-symmetry group $SU(\\mathcal{N})R \\times U(1)R$. We will not review the details of this construction but will instead only make a few physically relevant comments.\n\nFor $\\mathcal{N}>1$ supersymmetry, massive supermultiplets can be classified as either \\textit{short} or \\textit{long}. Short multiplets can arise if the supersymmetry algebra admits a central extension,\n\\begin{align}\n    \\{Q^a\\alpha,Q{\\beta}^{b}\\} &= \\epsilon_{\\alpha\\beta}Z^{ab} \\nonumber\\\\\n    \\{Q^{\\dagger}{a\\dot{\\alpha}},Q{b\\dot{\\beta}}^{\\dagger}\\} &= \\epsilon_{\\dot{\\alpha}\\dot{\\beta}}Z_{ab}.\n\\end{align}\nSince $Z^{ab}$ is a central charge, it commutes with all other operators in the super-Poincar\\'e algebra (\\ref{susyalgebra}), including the supercharges. This implies the existence of additional, additive quantum numbers $Z_i$, $i=1,...,\\mathcal{N}/2$ carried by every component state of a supermultiplet. Such an algebra has a representation on physical states only if the mass $m$ and central charges $Z_i$ satisfy the BPS bounds,\n\\begin{align}\n\\label{BPS}\n    m\\geq Z_i\\,.\n\\end{align}\nAt the special values $m=Z_i$, for some subset of $i$, there are fewer states in the multiplet than the generic (long multiplet) case, since some of the supercharges annihilate all of the states. The existence of an additive quantum number violates assumptions (i) and (iii); for a BPS multiplet with central charge $Z$ we would require a distinct multiplet with central charge $-Z$ to be consistent with the CPT theorem. We therefore conclude:\n\\begin{center}\n    \\noindent\\fbox{\n\\begin{minipage}{14cm}\nA massive graviton in a model with $\\mathcal{N}>1$ supersymmetry, must be a component of a \\textit{long} supermultiple"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 42661 | 0.8112783554 | 0.7929596477 | 1.0491105976 | 2.9282275416 | G | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

We not have time to consider cycling\n4. Transit Oriented Development: what research did you do on value capture?\nDidn't get into value uplift not done enough\n5. What would you have done if you had had 6 months?\nIf we had we would have done more consultation, and considered options like no parking on King and Queen Streets [major streetcar routes in downtown Toronto] as well as reconsidering truck delivery rules\n6. Does concentration on office employment makes peak hours worse?\nAn excellent relief line will help\n7. Development charges?\nThese are under review. We don't charge the true cost of debt in suburbs. They got hooked on Development Cost Charges: they are a perverse incentive \"like a drug\".\n8. You talked about congestion not Climate change or carbon taxes. Flooding Richmond might be a bigger cost than congestion\nWe didn't look at Carbon tax not viable. Canada is becoming less interested in being green\nPeople are stretched and cranky\nCost of collection of tolls is too high\nRevenue from gas tax has a limited life. The 1m more cars the rein expects will help but it is time limited\n9 Province doesn't have a clue about munis\nFrom where you sit is what you see. TTC is bigger than Metrolinx but they have to concentrate on immediate political situations. Maybe need a provincial office for the Metro area \u2013 that used to be the case in Toronto when Gardner Church ran it. BC should bring Metro Vancouver and Translink together\n10 Do people understand opportunity cost (citing the avoided cost of congestion she referenced)? E.g. road tolls\n\"I am not optimistic that there is enough white space\". The speed of communications defeats the consideration of complex issues. \"The big lie is winning\"\nGTA Toronto population is 5.8 million.\n\"Big Move\" is a comprehensive 25 year $50bn transit plan for GTHA with a goal of a 33% mode share. Phase 1 is the $16bn under way now which includes $800m for a makeover of Union Station. The Bloor Danforth subway extension to Scarborough City Centre will cost ~$3bn. The Eglinton Crosstown line is 12 miles png and will open in 2020. The 7 mile Finch West line will start in 2015 with scheduled completion in 2020. An 8 mile Sheppard East LRT will connect the Sheppard subway terminal at Don Mills to Morningside starting in 2017 completion by 2021. The Union Pearson line will be open next year. 37 miles of BRT are being built in York Region and Mississauga. Tunnelling has been completed on a 5.4 mile extension of the Spadina subway to Vaughn.

Recently, 60 shapers from different hubs met for the first time to lead a panel at the 2018 WTO Public Forum.\nKharkiv is home to one of these hubs. Currently, this local hub is focusing on expanding and launching new projects. These exciting new initiatives include The MoreInfo Project, which is working towards catalyzing urban mobility and local tourism, The VR Marathon, which is utilizing innovative media technologies to promote the modernization of product variations, and several initiatives focusing on topics including developing the entrepreneurial spirit of youth, ecological issues, human rights, equality and accessibility and finally the creation and support of cultural bridges for artists between cities.\nBeing a part of the WEF community has many advantages. Each year, a variety of offline events are taking place within the World Economic Forum framework. Having access to the Young Global Leaders and WEF community, along with a better understanding of how to discuss global challenges we are able to help shape local businesses, public policy, media, and cultural activities in order to compete on a global scale.\nSpecifically, we hope to create shared value together with local stakeholders, delivering unique strategic insights in exchange for the continuing growth of our expertise center of the 4th Industrial Revolution. We can use state of the art knowledge and interaction tools, among which are transformation maps analytical datasets of World Economic Forum, as well as its local governance protocols.\nBy inviting other Shapers to Ukraine, promoting regional events, international forums and continuing to create connections we hope to further public diplomacy. We try to think positively. However, we are occasionally faced with failures, caused by a weak local understanding of global context. One of them was our idea to invite Shapers all over the world to Kharkiv for an international forum to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the first skyscraper complex in Europe, Derzhprom, to promote the region. This did not happen as, unfortunately, our biggest hurdles at this time continue to be the lack of support and understanding of these initiatives by city administration officials. We hope this will change soon.\nThe hub's most recent plans include organizing a series of live stream World Economic Forum events, focusing on crowd-design and research on city readiness to undergo the 4th Industrial Revolution, nurturing Shapers' projects and searching for new members.\nAt this stage of hub development, we are interested in collaboration with international organizations and the local community to accelerate hub projects and, correspondingly, help clusters, associations and regional representatives gain more visibility in the Global Shapers network and on the World Economic Forum scene.\nAs further insights into the impact of the 4th Industrial Revolution and its effects on individuals are desperately needed, the Kharkiv Hub has the potential and opportunity to be at the forefront of the search for this information.\nWe invite all stakeholders to discuss"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 26984 | 0.7982664389 | 0.975603763 | 0.7168630233 | -0.0288801108 | E | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Fortunately, this is a feature well supported in Desmos, where an image can be added to the graph the same way a folder is added to a command line.\nBy default, Desmos likes to place an image so that its center is located at the origin, although we can still move/resize the image by dragging along its center or the 8 boundary points surrounding it. In addition, an image's opacity can be adjusted through the Gear Icon, and its dimensional values / coordinates of the center can also be configured numerically. Heck, we can even sneak in some undefined parameters in them, thereby turning a static image into a flying picture \u2014 where the dimension changes from one place to another!\nFind the mighty power of Desmos appealing and intend to use it extensively in the near future? Then it makes sense that you create an account, and work on your graphs while logged into the account. Why? Because then you can actually save these graphs for real, and share them with other like-minded individuals!\nIn fact, working on a graph while logged in allows you to give a title to the graph, so that if you decide to save it for later, a simple Ctrl + S will do. On the other hand, any saved graph can also be deleted \u2014 if needed to \u2014 by hitting the $\\displaystyle \\times$ button next to the name of the graph to be deleted.\nThe Share Graph Menu in Desmos. Why not elect to have your graph considered for staff pick and see what happens? \ud83d\ude09\nAnd if you're feeling generous enough, you can always share your work with others by generating a link for the graph \u2014 through the green Share Graph icon near the upper right corner. Remember, Desmos is a cloud-based application after all, which means that every time you save a graph and publish it somewhere online, you are in effect contributing to an ever-growing database of Desmos modules \u2014 all in the name of science and technology!\nOuf! That's quite a bit on an innocent-looking online graphing calculator isn't it? By the way, if you've manage to make it this far, you are already a true hero on your way to becoming a power user of Desmos! At the end of the day, whether you decide to use Desmos for graphing, computing, statistics or other purposes, the hope is that you would find a way to leverage these functionalities and adapt them to your own needs. Who knows, maybe you can even turn some of your inspiration into a fruitful, creative process \u2014 with perhaps a bit of technical twist along the way!\nAll right. Ready for the recap?

In many cases, photographers deliberately and artfully arranged their subjects, although their stated purpose was documenting debilitating or disconcerting medical conditions.\"\nRes Ipsa Loquitur\"(the thing speaks for itself), oil on canvas. 60\u2033 x 48\"\n\"I wrestle with this intersection of beauty and distress. As I reinvent the likeness of an individual, I give them authority from what was originally a position of vulnerability. My aim is to confront the viewer with sensations both of being the unconventional 'other' and of human commonality.\nWe are Made a Spectacle\nThe people I paint are not passive; they confront, make eye contact with the viewer, or make you feel as if you've happened upon a scenario where you are a voyeur looking onto a very private scene.\nRepose, 5 ft x 5 ft\nAble-bodied people usually have the general reaction of being caught off guard. Sometimes the viewer's first response is to recoil in disgust, or are at least made uncomfortable. But if the viewer is willing to spend time with the piece, after they get over this initial feeling of discomfort, they usually find the experience very rewarding and most find familiarity with it. But they first have to be vulnerable with the piece.\"\nLamentation, 5ft x 4 ft\n\"As far as I can tell, my work seems to have resonated very well with physically challenged people. At least I haven't had anyone with any sort of abnormality confront me about being offended; in fact, its been quite the opposite. I could tell many stories of people finding comfort in my work. A man once told me that my painting Lamentation gave him comfort in regards to his twelve-year-old son's suicide.\nI've had other clients who bought specific pieces because it associated with illness in their life. People with terrible spinal injuries being attracted to work with this fractured spine motif, or even a mother whose attraction to a boy in my painting was because of its connection to her terminally ill child.\nEvado, oil, encaustic on panel\nI don't have many concerns regarding my work in terms of exploitation. The nature of my source material insures there is no specific living person depicted. In the art world today there are so many different examples of exploitation, from artists giving birth as performance art, to artists being exploited by the dealers and institutions that are supposed to help them. I care a lot about the people in my work and their conditions. By depicting this sort of subject matter, I'm trying to confront attitudes of a sometimes flawed society. Like artists Joel-Peter Witkin and Andres Serrano, I am sometimes accused of exploitation; but I believe their exploration through art is sometimes misunderstood by viewers who refuse or are unable to take a look at themselves. Which is what a lot of good art strives to do \u2013 to make the viewer reassess themselves in a critical light, or for them to feel akin to an image or person that initially prompts feelings of disgust or discomfort.\"\nSt. Agatha, oil on panel, 19th century wood frame\n\"I think the topic of exploitation is one big grey area. One person's idea of exploitation is different from another's; and the word is probably over-used. I think some artists go too far out of their way to avoid controversy; while others are constantly looking for a new angle. Controversy attracts attention, and in an already over-saturated art world, this is a vehicle that is all too often used to promote oneself. I think if the exploitation yields a broader understanding of an important subject matter, it may very well be a positive outcome. I don't think we should avoid all conflict; but each scenario is different and it's up to the viewer to judge for themselves.\"\nLe Bourreau, oil on canvas.\nPainting on antique column base.

Private traders often made for the easily recognizable landmark, stopping a few days in the port and unloading some of the finer things they had collected from around the islands'things which seldom made their way to the rest of Bilkan.\nA curious, yearly event was the migratory trek of the crabs across Yarali. Once per year, the crabs would swarm from the sea at the northern end and march relentlessly through the village of Yarali, eventually reaching a cove by the Woods of Tranquility where they would lay their young. This had become a yearly festival of sorts amongst the villagers. This however, like many things, all changed with the coming of Blood's armies.\nThe tale of Yarali is now a tragic one. Unlike most other locations on Tilmar where Blood's forces arrived and attacked until all people bowed into submission and then moved to the next town, in Yarali, they stayed and fortified.\nThe villagers were turned into slaves with the surviving males chopping trees and building boats under torturous supervision and the females working in the fields, foraging for food to feed the troops, or worse, given as play things to Blood's more higher ranking officers. More and more, villagers went missing or were slain on the spot as examples to the others for crimes no worse than stealing food or attempting escape. Sleeper's Isle, where the village had long buried their dead, now had ceremonies almost daily.\nOn the final day, when Blood's forces finally fell and the island was liberated, the outcome was not so sweet for the remaining people of Yarali. The village was practically burned to the ground, and many of the remaining villagers were slain randomly by Blood's troops in fits of rage. Those who survived did so by fleeing to the beaches and by hiding in the many caves. When the smoke from their burned village had cleared the air, the remaining villagers of Yarali crept back up to their smoldering homes. With heavy hearts, they began moving the bodies of their fallen friends to Sleeper's Isle.\nYet, as a testament to the strength and resilience of the Bilkanese people, once the last of the dead had been buried, and the last scorched building finally tumbled to the ground, a tear streaked Marsha Availie clambered to a clear spot in the village. She slowly began dragging planks of wood over to the area, arranging them carefully on the floor. The villagers watched, feeling lost and in despair.\n\"What are you doing, Marsha?\" One asked quietly. With a shaking hand, she reached for some nails and a hammer on the floor. She stood with a determined smile as tears flooded her cheeks.\n\"I'm rebuilding my house.\" And she proceeded to hammer two planks of wood together with obvious awkwardness. One by one, the last of the villagers of Yarali approached her, dragging wood and hammers and nails with them. By the time the sun set, one small, hastily built hut stood in Yarali with the survivors all huddled in it for the night.\nIt was slow going, but filled with determination, the survivors slowly began rebuilding Yarali, even though their numbers were few. Unfortunately, no respite came for the people. With their numbers dwindled, a tribe of goblins that roamed the cove and would normally have let them be, now made attacks on the struggling village, stealing what they could. Troops had been sent to deal with this problem and assist the villagers; however, with the sudden declaration of war from the Telish Throne, they were immediately sent back to the border, leaving the Yarali villagers to once again cope on their own. Recent reports from the village indicate they are surviving, but just barely. There is a great respect for all survivors of the Yarali onslaught and a deep sympathy for the things they had to endure. Help is far from coming though.\nRetrieved from About The"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 3953 | 1.0550805818 | 1.0543914205 | 0.1386000695 | -0.0295304534 | O | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 |
| <details><summary>Click to expand</summary>"A popular question that consultants at Select International are often asked by our clients is how we can prevent cheating or faking on assessments. So, before I provide some insight on the question, here's a quiz to test your opinions on the issue.\nWhat is the best way to prevent cheating and faking on assessments?\na. Provide candidates with different versions of an assessment.\nc. Provide fake questions and catch candidates in a lie.\nd. Tell candidates that if they do not answer questions truthfully, they will be disqualified from the hiring process.\nIf you chose e, you are correct. There are a variety of ways that your organization can prevent cheating on assessments, and some are easier to implement than others. The good news is, although cheating and faking cannot be 100% eliminated from the application process, your organization can significantly cut down on those dishonest practices by taking some precautionary measures that I will outline below.\nIf your company has taken the time and expense to assemble an excellent culture and rigorous selection process that includes pre-employment assessments, you are likely concerned about ways candidates may try to circumvent the process. Just like a manufacturing company is likely concerned about sending bad products to market, since a recall can cost the organization money, time, and reputation, people are also valuable assets, so avoiding hiring \"damaged goods\" should also be a priority. Especially if your company is an employer of choice in the community, candidates might do anything they can to get their foot in the door, including lying on an application. So, how do you prevent fakers or cheaters from \"gaming the system\"?\nCatch candidates in a lie. Select designs our assessment content to include fake items. For example, if a candidate says they have experience using a \"door de-hinger,\" we know that they are lying, because that piece of equipment is made-up. If the candidate is lying on fake items, it's possible that he did not answer other items truthfully, and the assessment is designed to screen out those individuals.\nUse a multi-step hiring process. Even if candidates manage to pass through a screening assessment, having a multi-hurdle selection process in place can prevent them from being hired into your organization. A structured interview can uncover some items that the assessment missed, if you use the opportunity to confirm some of the candidate's responses from their application or assessment. For example, in Select's Fit assessments, candidates answer questions to determine their preference regarding performing certain types of jobs. In an assessment, if the candidate indicates that she prefers the type of job in which she has the opportunity to learn a variety of skills and perform different tasks, because she thinks that is what the job requires, you can ask an interview question to confirm that task variety is actually important to her.\nProctor assessments and provide warnings. It's possible to think about preventing cheating on assessments the same way stores try to thwart shoplifting. Some businesses use cameras and signs to indicate that shoppers are being watched to ensure they don't shoplift, and if they do they will be prosecuted. If your company proctors assessments and checks each candidate's photo ID beforehand, the chance that a candidate's friend or family member will complete their assessment will drastically decrease. Another option is to provide a written warning in applications and assessments, informing candidates that if they do not answer questions truthfully, they will be disqualified from the hiring process. It is helpful to remember that for personality assessments that do not measure cognitive ability, fakers or cheaters won't be at an advantage because there are no \"correct\" answers. Still, it is ideal for hiring managers to have accurate assessment data from the real applicant, rather than from his or her mother or brother.\nAlternate forms. Proctoring assessments can be expensive and time-intensive. So another way to thwart cheaters who may try to share test data with others, is to create alternate forms of your assessments. This means that no two assessments will look alike. Whether it means providing different math problems for each candidate, or switching the order of assessment content sections, by providing candidates with online assessments like the alternate forms versions that Select International has developed, cheating becomes significantly less achievable.\nOne of these ways will help reduce cheating and faking. Two of them will bring that possibility down even lower. If your employee assessment process follows all four checks and balances, chances are very low that your candidates will cheat during the process. Be sure to take a careful look at your organization's current process to ensure that"</details> | 1024 | C4 | 7961 | 0.1921850615 | -0.0479642998 | 1.7694030488 | -0.0295304534 | O | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Now, the family-owned chocolatier is continuing its legacy in a new homeland.\nby Diana Hubbell\nNov 19 2018, 8:54pm\nAll photos courtesy the author\nLast July, a caravan of Porsches, Ferraris, and Lamborghinis roared into a small shopping plaza off of Westheimer Road in Houston, Texas. By the time the sun started to go down, the party had spilled into the parking lot, with dancers performing choreographed sword fights for the cheering crowd. More than 300 people came from all over the state, as well as farther-flung cities in California, New York, and Oklahoma. All of them had come for one reason: chocolate.\nWhile all that fanfare might seem like overkill for a candy shop, ChocolatZeina's grand reopening was the culmination of years of struggle that warranted a raucous celebration. The business's roots and reputation trace back to Damascus, Syria, where Bashar Slik worked as a chocolatier for decades. In 2014, the United States was bombing Raqqa and Bashar al-Assad's regime was enlisting all men over the age of 18 to fight in the Syrian Army. Attempts to dodge the draft resulted in forced conscription or imprisonment. Fearing what was to come, Bashar boarded a one-way flight to the U.S. with his son Mohammed and wife Raida, seeking asylum.\n\"A lot of my friends were drafted. I'm the only boy in my family, so my parents wanted to run away,\" Mohammed, who is now nearly 26, remembers. They chose to settle down in Houston, where a few friends and relatives were already living. \"We came to find a safe, new life and this is the only thing we know: making chocolate.\"\nSince Syria's civil war flared up in 2011, media coverage of the country has been a grim onslaught of reports of extraordinary cruelty, civilian casualties, and the plight of more than 4.8 million displaced refugees seeking sanctuary. Hellish descriptions of violence have a way of eclipsing all that came before them. It's easy to forget with all the headlines that Damascus was once a place of spectacular beauty, known for 2,500-year-old streets and souks full of fragrant rose petals, black walnuts, apricots, persimmons, figs, and apples the size of a baby's fist.\nAmong the many things that have been lost or overshadowed was a long, proud history of confectionery. Back in 2005, The New York Times wrote, \"Even in a region known for its devotion to sweet foods, Damascene confectioners are unrivaled, and to arrive somewhere without a supply of traditional sweets would constitute a crime against hospitality.\" Syrian sweets were once so beloved throughout the world that exports in 2010 totaled more than $60 million. During the month surrounding Ramadan, the average Syrian family consumed 13 pounds of treats like syrupy knafeh and flaky bitlawa.\nIn the intervening years, a number of the country's revered master confectioners have continued their work in exile in different corners of the world. Assam Hadhad founded Peace for Chocolate in Nova Scotia and the late chocolatier Bassam Ghraoui moved his namesake business to Budapest. The Sliks hoped to continue that tradition Texas.\nThey may be still building a name for themselves in their new home, but the family has been in the chocolate business since 1892, when Naseeb Slik first began conching cocoa solids. After his younger brother, Jawdat, opened Slik Chocolate in 1918, the family business expanded steadily. Under the management of Jawdwat's four sons, it grew to include seven branches in Syria and another two in Jordan. Their two-story factory was renowned for high-end confections ranging from dark chocolate truffles filled with emerald pistach"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 9741 | 2.0850765044 | 1.570092452 | 0.7346167105 | -0.0295304534 | J | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

To say whether or not making the switch is a good idea for your business, however, primarily depends on figuring out what your website needs right now that it currently lacks.\nCraft CMS has some unique capabilities that ExpressionEngine does not, but if your needs are relatively simple, then you may be able to save yourself the time and effort from transitioning into a new CMS by exploring more of ExpressionEngine's functionality.\nHere are a few examples where key differences in ExpressionEngine and Craft CMS can help you determine which platform is right for you.\nAre you getting ready to bump up and handle thousands more users?\nStatic caching options for Craft CMS have allowed it to soar in popularity around long-standing, open-source classics. While it's newer in history than the classics are, Craft CMS does so many things so much better. Craft CMS add-on developers have been making elegant solutions around caching (not to mention SEO, e-Commerce, and spam management, among others) while ExpressionEngine's selections of these kinds of add-ons has idled a bit.\nLooking for performance enhancements on a website for anything associated with heavy traffic?\nGo directly to Craft CMS and look no further.\nDo you want additional security or stability outside of high-traffic performance?\nStick with ExpressionEngine, at least for now. A move to Craft may only complicate these factors.\nDo you want out-of-the-box headless support?\nNothing ghoulish about this, my friend. Craft can handle GraphQL and has built-in support to configure feeds straight from section entries. For publishing anything past your website and past social networks 2FA API's, Craft has the ideal set-up. ExpressionEngine can be operated sort-of headless but with the head\u2014where templates are set up just to make feeds. Not bad, but feels extra.\nYou can add 1 or 2 of these to an ExpressionEngine site and be fine. Otherwise, if you're building new and/or depending on it heavily, it's Craft CMS.\nSpeaking of add-ons...\n\"Each CMS has its own collection of 3rd party developed add-ons or plugins. Switching from ExpressionEngine and its add-ons, means comparing whether Craft has equivalent inherent functionality, or will need a free or paid plugin to replace it.\" says Niki Wolf, Petroglyph Creative web developer. Your work in determining if it's even possible to move from ExpressionEngine to Craft CMS should needs to include the viability of what is currently built in EE and how that will work in your new system.\nI want to set my cool design up on something I've heard is good software.\nThese are both good choices. You will struggle with Craft CMS a little more than ExpressionEngine if you are new to building websites. Both have help available both free and paid. ExpressionEngine is free to use, has no build process requirements, offers a predictable and flexible templating language (and upcoming Twig support!), and with optimal setup is just as, if not more, secure. Lastly, and I cannot stress this enough, there is room for you there, O code investigator. Enjoy the company of a longstanding dedicated community while growing your career.\nMy web design company says this is what we have to do.\nGood for you for getting a second opinion. If you want our opinion on if you should switch or not, you can book a chat with us for free.\nDo you have a stakeholder who is eager to pursue the latest ways in all things? How about one who prefers stability?\nCraft CMS websites generally use a collection of modern frameworks as reference code that are compiled when it is installed on a server. Same goes for add-ons. Managing these dependencies can be tricky and has been known to sink a day or two of even experienced developers' time, in connection with unexpected updates elsewhere or just forgetting the basics. When you have a development company who keeps up with this for you, you don't need to worry about fragile command-line skills.\nOn the other hand - if your stakeholders are more along the lines of \"We just want what we want and we don't have to worry about anything happening to it,\" you may consider staying in ExpressionEngine and consulting a development team about"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 11730 | 0.2880623416 | -0.179351672 | 0.8386025925 | -0.0295304534 | E | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

They will only make it tougher for existing operators to compete. Companies and individuals that have done B.C. proud by making our jurisdiction a North American leader in reducing vehicle emissions from taxicabs.\nGo to any other jurisdiction in Canada, or pretty much in the U.S., and you will marvel at how comparatively few hybrid, propane, and electric cabs they have. In B.C.'s biggest cities, hybrids have become the go-to cars.\nThat is largely because of the eco-friendly operational policy that the Campbell government put in place in 2007-08, as part of its climate action plan. It established strict fuel consumption criteria for all new cabs operating in Metro Vancouver, Greater Victoria, or anywhere else specified by the Passenger Transportation Board.\nKiss that rule goodbye. It won't be sustainable from a competition perspective, as the government also lowers its safety standards by eliminating today's current requirements for Class 4 licences.\nConsumers will notice changes\nAnd what of the B.C. Liberal government's much-vaunted \"taxi bill of rights\"?\nIt was another measure introduced in 2008 by the Campbell administration, in consultation with the B.C. Taxi Association, the Vancouver Taxi Association, and other taxi industry representatives, taxi user groups, local government, and enforcement officials.\nThat bill of rights has to be prominently displayed in every taxi in Metro Vancouver. It guarantees all customers rights to certain services, as it also offer rights to cab drivers. Since it was introduced, a number of cab companies in Greater Victoria and Sooke have also voluntarily adopted that bill of rights.\nWhat will happen to that consumer protection feature in the future? Will the ride-sharing companies be bound by the same standards and bill of rights?\nDon't count your lucky shamrocks. My guess is it too will be abandoned in the name of \"fair competition\" that sacrifices consumer protection whenever it collides with the wishes of Uber's chief executive, Travis Kalanick.\nYes, that would be the same guy you saw on the news belittling one of his own company's drivers. The guy whose firm has come under attack from its own former employees about its macho corporate culture and allegations of sexual harassment.\nI suppose I shouldn't say any more. After all, that is also the same company that the New York Times found was for years secretly using a software snooping tool called \"greyball\" to \"deceive the authorities in markets where its low-cost ride-hailing service was resisted by law enforcement\".\nThen again, that tool only works if you download the Uber app and use it in the first place. I, for one, won't be doing that anytime soon.\nAs the Irish Times also reported last month, the #DeleteUber social media hashtag has allegedly cost Uber more than 200,000 users to date.\nThis Saint Patrick's Day, you might bear that in mind as you also reflect on that old Irish saying, \"We're on this earth together, and if we would be brothers; fight-not on your own behalf, but for the sake of others.\"\nJohn Horgan needs all the help he can get to take his fight to the people on May 9. It's going to be a royal donnybrook"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 12737 | 0.4551627439 | 0.2969555306 | 0.0168605003 | -0.0295304534 | K | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

Here, we report a micro-cable power textile for simultaneously harvesting energy from ambient sunshine and mechanical movement. Solar cells fabricated from lightweight polymer fibres into micro cables are then woven via a shuttle-flying process with fibre-based triboelectric nanogenerators to create a smart fabric. A single layer of such fabric is 320\u2009\u03bcm thick and can be integrated into various cloths, curtains, tents and so on. This hybrid power textile, fabricated with a size of 4\u2009cm by 5\u2009cm, was demonstrated to charge a 2\u2009mF commercial capacitor up to 2\u2009V in 1\u2009min under ambient sunlight in the presence of mechanical excitation, such as human motion and wind blowing. The textile could continuously power an electronic watch, directly charge a cell phone and drive water splitting reactions.\nWang, Z. L. & Song, J.

For example, many granite batholiths contain zircon grains that are foreign to the host magma and whose age spectra match the detrital zircon age spectra of the adjacent sedimentary units. This relationship is a clear indication that sedimentary contamination occurred in the upper crust. Unfortunately, the geochemical proxies used to establish the sedimentary contamination only provide indirect evidence for the subduction of sedimentary material into the asthenospheric wedge. Such indirect evidence includes seismic stratigraphy showing sedimentary units being subducted beneath the forearc and whiffs of sedimentary geochemical signals in arc volcanics. Although these evidences point towards sediment being subducted deep into the asthenospheric wedge where it melts and contaminates the magmas coming off the subducting slab, they do not preserve direct evidence of sediment melting in the mantle.\nTo acquire direct evidence of processes happening deep in the mantle, I set my sights on the Oman/UAE ophiolite, where a thick succession of mantle peridotite is preserved beneath a complete stratigraphic section of oceanic crust. Previous work has shown that this ophiolite not only preserves an intact record of oceanic crustal stratigraphy, but also geochemical features of a subduction zone in the oceanic crust. This implies the ophiolite formed in a supra-subduction setting, where during the earliest phase of subduction, extension in the upper plate caused rifting and formation of oceanic crust above a subduction zone.\nFigure 2: Oceanic crustal stratigraphy of the Oman/UAE ophiolite comprised of (clockwise from top left): pillow basalts, sheeted dykes, layered gabbros, and mantle peridotite. Credit: Christopher Spencer.\nDuring fieldwork in the ophiolite, while traversing the 8-15 km thickness of the mantle peridotite, I encountered a number of granitoid dykes that cross cut the peridotite, but do not cross the petrologic Moho. Many of these dykes contained tourmaline, muscovite, biotite, and even andalusite, minerals that would be expected from the melting of sedimentary material. Finding these minerals in the mantle indicates these grantoid dykes formed from the melting of sedimentary material and here they were within the mantle! Subsequent analysis of zircon grains from these granitoid dykes revealed the age of these dykes was equivalent to the age of the overlying ophiolite providing bullet-proof evidence that they intruded while the ophiolite was forming above a subduction zone. To provide the nail in the coffin for a sedimentary origin, I performed oxygen isotope analysis of the zircon and quartz. Sedimentary material has a distinct oxygen isotopic composition and igneous rocks that are thought to have experienced sediment contamination have \u03b418O values that lie along mixing lines between a sediment end member and the mantle. The oxygen isotopic analyses of the sub-Moho granitoids of the Oman/UAE ophiolite revealed the highest \u03b418O values ever measured in igneous rocks, providing unequivocal evidence that these granitoids represent pure sediment melts. In a paper published in Geology (Spencer et al., 2017), my coauthors and I argue these igneous rocks represent the first direct and in situ evidence of sediment melting in the mantle. Lucky for us, we have just scratched the surface of the exciting things left to learn about these fascinating granitoids and I look forward to the opportunity to return to the Oman/UAE ophiolite.\nFigure 3: Sub-Moho granitoids of the Oman/UAE ophiolite: A) Cathodoluminescence image of a zircon shown with location and result of \u03b418O analyses.

This fact makes graphene one of the most conductive materials known to man.\nHowever, despite their extraordinary properties, it is very difficult to control them. For example, in graphene it is impossible to switch on/off electrical currents using simple electrical potential, thus hindering the potential implementation of graphene in electronic devices.\nThis fundamental drawback \u2013 the lack of tunability \u2013 has been successfully overcome in a unique way by the physicists at the University of Exeter.\nCharlie-Ray Mann, the lead author of the paper published in Nature Communications, explains: \"For graphene, one usually has to modify the honeycomb lattice to change its properties, for example by straining the honeycomb lattice which is extremely challenging to do controllably.\"\n\"The key difference here is that the Dirac polaritons are hybrid particles, a mixture of light and matter components. It is this hybrid nature that presents us with a unique way to tune their fundamental properties, by manipulating only their light-component, something that is impossible to do in graphene\".\nThe researchers show that by embedding the honeycomb metasurface between two reflecting mirrors and changing the distance between them, one can tune the fundamental properties of the Dirac polaritons in a simple, controllable and reversible way.\n\"Our work has crucial implications for the research fields of photonics and of Dirac particles\", adds Dr Eros Mariani, principal investigator on the study.\n\"We have shown the ability to slow down or even stop the Dirac particles, and modify their internal structure, their \"chirality\" in technical terms, which is impossible to do in graphene itself\"\n\"The achievements of our work will constitute a key step along the photonic circuitry revolution\".\nLearn more: New half-light half-matter particles may hold the key to a computing revolution\nThe Latest on: Half-light half-matter particles\nNew half-light half-matter particles may hold the key to a computing revolution - [Phys.org](http://phys.org/)\nPhotonics Breakthrough: Half-Light Half-Matter Quasiparticle Based LED - SciTechDaily\nIt's chilly here: Lowest temperature at Fermilab reached in equipment for dark matter experiment - Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory\nAn Influential Female Astronomer Is Getting Her Due - The Atlantic\nFinding new physics will require a new particle collider - The Economist\nPhysicists score double hit in LED research - Science Daily\nThe Cost of Fleeing Climate Change - The New Yorker\nCoupled exploration of light and matter - Science Daily\n\"The Galaxy That Revealed Dark Matter\" \u2013A 'Sleeping Monster' 2.5 Times Width of the Milky Way - The Daily Galaxy --Great Discoveries Channel\nPotentially Habitable Planet Found - Mental Floss\nNew half-light half-matter particles may hold the key to a computing revolution\nPhysicists at the University of Exeter have taken an important step towards this goal, as they have discovered new half-light half-matter particles that inherit some of the remarkable features of ...\nGen-next quantum devices from half-light,"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 4829 | 1.2112235807 | 1.5772549663 | 1.5563588027 | 1.4454464887 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

Magenta and violet balls, green and yellow tubes denote indium, arsenic, tin and sulphur atoms, respectively. A sulphur chain in red. Stefan Wippermann, Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Eisenforschung GmbH\nNew artificial materials for semiconductors used in solar cells or photoelectrochemical cells that are designed from scratch with totally new and tailored properties: this is the latest research topic of Stefan Wippermann, head of the group \"Atomistic Modelling\" at the Max-Planck-Institut f\u00fcr Eisenforschung), and his team.\nThey characterized for the first time with atomic resolution a typical material system and are able to set design principles. Their work introduces a new class of nanocrystal-in-glass systems, which increase the efficiency of optoelectronics such as photovoltaics and light-induced water splitting. The Max Planck researchers published their latest findings in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.\nNanocrystals can be used as \"artificial atoms\" to create designer materials for electronic applications and solar energy conversion as they are controllable, potentially non-toxic and earth-abundant. In collaboration with the groups of Dmitri Talapin and Giulia Galli, University of Chicago, wet-chemical techniques were used to synthesize those nanocrystals and assemble them into semiconducting nanocomposites.\n\"One great advantage of designing nanocrystals is that we are able to choose their properties\", explains Wippermann. \"As we develop our own \"atoms\", we do not rely anymore on the chemical properties of elements but are able to design materials with target properties through nanostructuring.\"\nThat means the researchers can abstain for example from toxic or rare elements. And even though their current model system is still using toxic elements, they embed the nanocrystals into solid matrices so that the nanocrystals are not spread into air.\n\"The current key challenge is not the production of the nanocrystals themselves but rather the understanding and controlling of their interface chemistry and defects, as their surfaces and interfaces are only a few nanometres in size and buried inside the material\", says Wippermann.\nHe and his team produced and analysed buried interfaces in solids of indium arsenide nanoparticles capped with thiostannate (Sn2S6-4) ligands as prototypical nanocomposites. The ligands are used during the synthesis of the nanocomposites. With the help of theoretical and experimental techniques they found that the ligands are not adsorbed as intact units but decompose upon contact with the nanocrystal surface, forming an amorphous matrix around the nanocrystals. Exactly this matrix influences the electronic transport of the nanocrystal solids, as the decomposed ligands form a passivation layer on the nanocrystal surface and only on top of this layer an intact ligand may adsorb.\nAnother passivation mechanism is the incorporation of sulphur into the subsurface layer. Arsenic in turn diffuses into the matrix, leading to the formation of characteristic defects. These defects explain the observed switching between positive and negative photoconductivity.\nSimulations showed that the indium arsenide nanocrystals draw sulphur from the matrix leading to the formation of a sulphur shell around the nanocrystals. Sulphur also affects the amount and character of defects in the nanocomposite: A high sulphur content reduces the number of dangling bond defects in the nanocomposite and leads to the formation of sulphur chains acting as hole-conducting interconnects between the nanocrystals.\nThe Max Planck scientists show that the properties of nanocrystal-based solids are influenced by the size, shape, composition, surface chemistry and mutual interactions of nanocrystals. The strong quantum confinement of charge carriers inside the nanocrystals enable efficient carrier multiplication, where a single high energy photon creates multiple electron-hole pairs, which contribute to the conductivity.\nThis way optoelectronics can be made more efficient. Nanocrystals capped with molecular metal chalcogenide complexes have especially high electron mobilities, which allow for fast"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 5813 | 1.4824193156 | 2.0786309691 | 1.9520124026 | 1.7888273641 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

This knowledge could be used to create microbial communities for targeted biofuels production, or to understand and mitigate drivers of cyanobacteria or algae pond crashes. Regardless of the biofuel target, ABPP is currently being used to functionally characterize microbes and microbial communities, and future prospects for this application are limitless.\nOver the past few years, ABPP has boomed in the field of chemical biology through elucidation of target functional proteins in vivo and in vitro. ABPP techniques that integrate transcriptomics, proteomics, fluorescence and electron microscopy, molecular biology (e.g., structural biology, mutant and gene cloning technologies), and other disciplines will provide comprehensive characterization of the catalytic and regulatory mechanisms of target enzymes, enzyme complexes, and entire biosynthetic pathways, thereby accelerating systems-level understanding required for efficient and economic biofuel technology development. Where transcriptomic and global proteomic analyses can only be used to infer functional capability in a biological system, ABPP directly measures function. There are exciting opportunities for coupling omic strategies to ABPP, such as linking post-translational modifications (e.g., phosphorylation, acetylation, redox) directly to enzyme function. Recent advances in the burgeoning field of intact proteomics may soon enable such comprehensive and high-throughput analyses that assign post-translational modifications to an enzyme's active state. Additionally, lipidomic and metabolomics analyses may be coupled directly to ABPP data to correlate metabolic output directly to protein functions.\nBeyond biofuels research and development, ABPP can fill a critical need for new technologies to connect uncharacterized microbial species or guilds to ecosystem processes. While metagenome sequencing has paved the road towards establishing these linkages, critical technical and bioinformatic challenges remain [71]. ABPP cannot only inform protein function, but can be directly assigned to genes via LC\u2013MS-based proteomics. This provides a powerful approach for improving functional annotation of genomes including those of uncultivated members of communities that carry out critical ecosystem services such as carbon and nutrient cycling and bioremediation, in addition to secure and sustainable bioenergy production. The future is full of possibilities when omic strategies merge to define how cells work, and ABPP plays an important role in filling in the gaps of our knowledge relating to the organisms and pathways of interest.\nABP:\nactivity-based probe\nABPP:\nactivity-based protein profiling\nGH:\nglycoside hydrolase\nLC\u2013MS:\nliquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry\nPTM:\nYL, JKF, NCS, PN and ATW designed, researched and wrote the review.

The Bargmann invariant was originally introduced to aid in the proof of Wigner's theorem on symmetry operators, but later found uses in quantum information science \\cite{bengtsson2017geometry} and quantum optics \\cite{simon1993bargmann}. \n We will show how to express all known geometric structures via three-point functions and also explain that, generally, $P^{(3)}$ contains information that cannot be recovered from even the global knowledge of the Berry phase and quantum metric.\n\n\n\nMore precisely, the Bargmann invariant contains novel information\nwhen the parameter manifold has dimension less than the dimension of $\\mathbb{C}P^n$. To make this clear, in our work we use the interpretation of the 3-point functions $P^{(3)}(x,y,z)$ in terms of the geodesic triangle build on the images of $x,y$ and $z$ in $\\mathbb{C}P^n$\\cite{hangan1994geometrical,mukunda1993quantum, pancharatnam1956generalized}. When $\\dim M < \\dim \\mathbb{C}P^n$, the image of $M$ forms a proper submanifold within $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ and the geodesics between different points of $M$ generically will not be contained within $M$, thus. revealing extrinsic geometry. We identify a fully symmetric 3-tensor $T{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma}$ as the simplest local object that captures this novel geometric information.\n\nPreviously, the approach of describing a quantum state depending on a parameter as a map to $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ has been successfully applied to classifying topological insulators \\cite{Chiu_2016}. In that case only the homotopy class of the map $M \\to \\mathbb{C}P^n$ mattered and the approach of the present work can be seen as an extension of the topological approach to also include geometric properties of the map. \n\nBeside capturing new geometry beyond the Berry curvature and quantum metric, our approach also significantly simplifies certain computations that involve band structures, yielding explicitly gauge invariant answers and revealing the geometric objects behind physical quantities. We will illustrate that by computing the conductivity of a flat band material and the polarization distribution in an insulator. Additionally, we explain what our results imply when applied to the geometry of Landau levels and the band structure of twisted bilayer graphene in the chiral limit.\n\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section \\ref{sec:projectors} we introduce the 3-point function $P(x,y,z)$ and describe its basic properties. In the next Section \\ref{sec:berry_phase}, the Berry phase is reinterpreted via $P(x,y,z)$ and its infinitesimal version $\\mathcal{A}^{x}{\\alpha}(y)$. Section \\ref{sec:int_vs_ext} describes the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic geometry that plays an important role in this work. Section \\ref{sec:local} covers the local geometric invariants that arise in the expansion of $P(x,y,z)$ when its arguments are close to each other. Section \\ref{sec:holomorphic} describes the special properties of holomorphic maps $M \\to \\mathbb{C}P^n$ and Section \\ref{sec:bands} shows how the approach of this work applies to band structure calculations. Finally, in Section \\ref{sec:disuccsion} we conclude with a discussion and an outlook. \n\n\\section{Geometry via projectors} \\label{sec:projectors}\nAssume we have a set of wave functions, $\\psi(x)\\rangle$, where $x$ belongs to some parameter space $M$, normalized by $\\langle \\psi(x)\\psi(x)\\rangle = 1$.

The fact that $T$ is non-trivial  shows that, while Berry phases for all contractible loops vanish for this band structure, 3-point functions support non-zero phases. \n\nWhen only the bottom band is filled we expect all low-energy properties to be functions of just the geometry of the this band and the leading behavior of the phenomena sensitive to the phase of Bloch wavefunctions to be determined by $T$. \n\n\\section{Discussion and Outlook} \\label{sec:disuccsion\n\n\nIn this paper we developed a framework for describing all gauge invariant properties of a submanifold of quantum states via the three point function $P^{(3)}(x,y,z)$.\nWe showed that the knowledge of these functions uniquely determines the immersion of the submanifold into the complex projective space $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ up to the action of a holomorphic isometry of $\\mathbb{C}P^n$.  Being a complete description, our approach allows one to view all previously studied geometric objects in a unified way. Moreover, certain objects that appear in the expansion of $P^{(3)}$, in particular the 3-tensor $T_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma},$ are sensitive to extrinsic geometry, and, as a consequence, are functionally independent from intrinsic objects such as the quantum metric and Berry curvature. As an illustration for that, we constructed an immersion where the metric is flat and the Berry curvature vanishes but the three tensor $T_{\\alpha\\beta\\gamma}$ can vary. This shows, that one should not rely on the quantum geometric tensor as the complete description of a manifold quantum states, but consider the extrinsic geometry as well, for example, by working with $\\mathcal{A}^X(y)$. In contradistinction to the general case, we prove that when the parameter space is 2 dimensional and the map to $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ is holomorphic, the quantum geometric tensor is sufficient to fully reconstruct the map.\n\nAn important result of our work is the procedure that employs the interpretation of $P^{(3)}$ in terms of geodesic triangles in $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ to relate the terms in the local expansion of $P^{(3)}$ to geometric objects in an efficient way.  \n\nWe envision our approach to find most uses in condensed matter calculations involving electronic band structures. In Section \\eqref{sec:bands} we have shown how the distribution of polarization in insulators is straightforwardly rewritten in terms of $\\mathcal{A}^{X}(y)$ and the moments of polarization distribution are expressed in terms of the objects $Q^{(n)}$ that appear in the expansion of $\\mathcal{A}^{X}(y)$. This can potentially lead to a direct experiment measurement of $T_{\\alpha \\beta \\gamma}$. Likewise, we were able to express the conductivity of a flat band material  in a modulated field $\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)$ in terms of $\\mathcal{A}^{X}(y)$. Expanding $\\sigma_{\\alpha \\beta}(q)$ in $q$ again leads to direct ways of measuring local structures $Q^{(n)}{\\alpha_1 \\dots \\alpha{n+1}}(k)$\n\nAs the next step in the development of our approach, we would like to understand how our analysis generalizes to the case of projectors on  $k$-dimensional subspaces (here only a single state projector has been considered). In this case, one would need to study maps to the complex Grassmannian $Gr(n + 1,k)$\n\nAnother direction where progress can be made is the refinement of our approach to the case where the map to $\\mathbb{C}P^n$ satisfies certain constraints. These could be coming from discrete symmetries in solid state systems such as time reversal and inversion and well as the specifics of the crystalline group.\n\nWe would like to particularly stress possible applications to correlated flat-band physics where band dispersion vanishes and the dynamics are governed by geometry. An interesting example is the geometric condition for the formation of a Fractional Chern insulator from flat bands\\cite{Roy_2014} and the superfluid weight of a flat-band superconductor\\cite{Peotta_2015} that has been formulated using $\\omega"</details> | 1024 | ArXiv | 22009 | 1.2084842298 | 0.6895508471 | 1.3433145565 | 2.418358969 | G | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

The team is using nanotechnology to create a probe capable of trapping and tuning a single electron to create the rarified physical state in nearby magnetic electrodes. Engineers say learning how quantum criticalities form in nature could one day help them harness that power for high-temperature superconductivity.\nCurrent applications of high-temperature superconductors include medical imaging systems, infrared sensors, analog signal processing devices and microwave devices. A better understanding of the properties of the material could lead to its use in power transmission, energy storage devices, particle accelerators and rotating machinery, among others.\nThe Rice University probe, a transistor thousands of times smaller than a living cell, is described in research published online in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\"The traditional theory of metals, which has held sway for 50 years and has fostered terrific technological advances in computing and materials science, breaks down completely in matter that exists in a quantum critical state,\" said Qimiao Si, professor of physics and astronomy at Rice and the lead theoretician on the project. \"Previous experiments indicate that quantum criticality is characterized by the inherent quantum effect of entanglement, and the nanoscale magnetic probe we've proposed could provide a controlled and tunable setting to study entanglement at a quantum critical point.\"\nThe term \"quantum critical point\" refers to a phase transition. Just as water goes through a phase transition when it turns to ice or steam, all matter is subject to phase transitions due to fluctuations produced by the peculiar forces of quantum mechanics.\nThe probe proposed by Si and colleagues is based on a transistor with an active channel measuring just a few billionths of meter across. The transistor also uses a pair of electrodes made of ferromagnetic metal. The researchers plan to trap a single electron in the active channel between the electrodes. Then they will capitalize on a uniquely quantum effect -- the tendency of a trapped electron to tunnel, or \"wink\" out of existence in one place and appear in another -- to establish a quantum critical state in the metallic electrodes that trap the tiny particle.\n\"In principle, we can use the gate voltage in this setup to tune the physical state,\" said Douglas Natelson, assistant professor of physics and astronomy and of electrical and computer engineering. \"We should be able to move the system from a quantum critical state and back again, simply by turning the knob on the voltage. That's a level of precision that's never been possible in another experimental system, and it's really nanotechnology -- the control of matter at the atom-by-atom level -- that will make it possible.\"\nElementary particles like electrons have an intrinsic angular momentum known as spin. The probe's design will allow the physicists to confine an electron with its spin on one molecule inside the transistor. In one quantum state, the tunneling effect causes the constrained electron spin to become \"entangled\" with the spins of electrons in the nearby metal electrodes. The magnetic nature of the electrodes also dictates the existence of a collective oscillation among the spins of electrons in the electrodes. These oscillations - known as \"spin waves\" -- will interact with the magnetic moment of the constrained electron's spin and try to break the entanglement. The quantum critical point occurs when it is broken and the material transitions from one quantum phase to the next.\nNatelson has already used the technique to study electron spin in similar molecules while using non-magnetic gold metal electrodes. Results of those experiments are due to be published shortly in the journal Physical Review Letters.\n\"The usage of the ferromagnetic electrodes in the proposed probe brings in spin waves, which couple to the local magnetic moment of the molecule as a fluctuating magnetic field,\" said theorist and co-author Stefan Kirchner, a postdoctoral fellow of physics and astronomy at Rice. \"It is this coupling that gives rise to the ability to tune the degree of -- and even destroy -- the magnetic quantum entanglement.\" The effect is manifested in the unique way that the electrical conductance of the transistor depends on temperature and frequency.\nThough nano in scale, the new probe serves as a realistic model system to el"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 26901 | 1.3618878779 | 1.9568682255 | 1.9723023308 | 1.7732191425 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 | 5 |

The same framework that allows BigSMILES to accommodate stochastic covalent connectivity can be extended to non-covalent bonds, enhancing its value for polymers, supramolecular materials, and colloidal chemistry. Non-covalent bonds are captured through the inclusion of annotations to pseudo atoms serving as complementary binding pairs, minimal key/value pairs to elaborate other relevant attributes, and indexes to specify the pairing among potential donors and acceptors or bond delocalization. Incorporating these annotations into BigSMILES line notation enables the representation of four common classes of non-covalent bonds in polymer science: electrostatic interactions, hydrogen bonding, metal\u2013ligand complexation, and \u03c0\u2013\u03c0 stacking. The principal advantage of non-covalent BigSMILES is the ability to accommodate a broad variety of non-covalent chemistry with a simple user-orientated, semi-flexible annotation formalism. This goal is achieved by encoding a universal but non-exhaustive representation of non-covalent or stochastic bonding patterns through syntax for (de)protonated and delocalized state of bonding as well as nested bonds for correlated bonding and multi-component mixture. By allowing user-defined descriptors in the annotation expression, further applications in data-driven research can be envisioned to represent chemical structures in many other fields, including polymer nanocomposite and surface chemistry.\nThis article is Open Access\nSupplementary information PDF (570K)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1039/D2SC02257E\nEdge Article\nAll publication charges for this article have been paid for by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nChem.

Its MP3 encoder was allied to a music library management system, and functioned better than many of the hobbyist-style MP3 encoder/library systems that had begun to appear for Windows.\n\nBut in March 2000 the bubble burst. MusicMatch survived by marshalling its resources very carefully. 'Everyone had thought that as long as you had eyeballs [coming to your site] that was everything', Ohlweiler says. MusicMatch's chief executive, Dennis Mudd, knew differently: cash in the bank spoke more loudly. People would still pay for good software for CD ripping on Windows. They husbanded their cash and hunkered down.\n\nThe iPod's launch intrigued the team, who were soon talking to Apple about tweaking the MusicMatch software so millions of Windows users \u2013 a huge, untapped market for the iPod \u2013 could use it with their machines.\n\nApple resisted at first: the iPod was meant to sell more Macs. But internally executives were already debating: why give it over to Windows? Would people buy an iPod if they didn't have a Mac? Would they buy a Mac eventually if first they used an iPod on Windows? Jobs resisted: Windows users would get it 'over my dead body'. Fadell insisted that 'this needs to get to the PC'. In the end, the prospect of expanding the iPod market 20-fold was too persuasive. There was a recession on. Anything that got more people buying Apple products was good.\n\nIn July 2002, Apple introduced its second-generation iPod, with up to 20GB of storage \u2013 and also 'iPod for Windows', using MusicMatch's software to connect to Windows PCs. Ohlweiler knew though that the relationship with Apple was on borrowed time: 'We could see that if it took off then they would write iTunes for Windows and steamroller us,' The concern was that an iTunes for Windows might hurt MusicMatch's ability to sell software upgrades before it could turn users on to music subscriptions and sales. He had a number of meetings at Apple, where the details of forthcoming products would be discussed, generally at the engineer or manager level.\n\nOhlweiler could see a clash coming between Apple's ambitions and those of the Windows-based MP3 players, and computer manufacturers like Dell, which saw this as a market that could bolster its otherwise lacklustre consumer business. What the PC makers needed was some software that would save them the expense of having to devise their own on the computer \u2013 because writing software that could work with Windows Media Player would be reinventing the wheel if Microsoft was already doing it.\n\nMicrosoft, it turned out, was already doing it. All the PC companies would need then was to offer a physical player. The horizontal model was ready to be reapplied to the MP3 player market. Clearly Apple and the third-party software companies like MusicMatch faced a death sentence: Microsoft and the PC makers were about to come in and take it over, using the same economies of scale to crush the opposition.\n\nThe record companies were keen for this too, especially if Microsoft could write software that would protect their property \u2013 the songs being ripped off CDs. Although they had crushed the file-sharing incarnation of Napster in the courts, a more dangerous form of file sharing had replaced it, using true peer-to-peer systems such as LimeWire and Grokster, which simply didn't have a central company running them. In future the record labels would have to go after individual users pirating their material \u2013 not a situation they relished, though they felt that making an example of a few people would quickly solve the problem, and leave the market wide open for legal download services where they could control the pricing.\n\nMicrosoft was listening to the record companies' calls. Its strategy was to rip songs into its Windows Media Audio (WMA) format, which independent tests said sounded better than MP3, even while creating smaller files. Files ripped on PCs using Windows Media Player, the default system, would be transferred with digital rights management (DRM) \u2013 a sort of digital padlock \u2013 on to music players, preventing the songs being copied on to another PC, and tying the player to its owner's computer. WMA files protected in that way and uploaded to file-sharing networks wouldn't work on the PCs of anyone else who downloaded them.\n\nIt was a brilliant strategy \u2013 except for two things. First, on Windows, CD ripping was still a"</details> | 1024 | Book | 72013 | 0.7414249085 | 0.6640343898 | 0.3148688208 | 0.4074997517 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

As the United States is about half of Apple's business, and the iPod was available there first, it's a reasonable guess that Two million of those 2.8 million iPods were connected to the Music Store in its first year.\n\nIn other words, there was an average of 35 songs downloaded per year per iPod \u2013 equivalent to buying 3.5 CDs in that period. That's only slightly ahead of the average purchase per person in the United States. (If you assume some people were just downloading to iTunes, the per-iPod average falls further.)\n\n'That's only 1 per cent of all legal music sales [in the United States],' Rob Schoeben, Apple's head of product marketing, said later. 'But it also represents a technological disruption, to gain 1 per cent in just one year. And, you know, there's a lot of headroom for us to grow into.'\n\nBut were they additive purchases that people wouldn't otherwise have made, in which case Apple was helping the music business to grow? Or were people shunning 10-track CDs for cherry-picked individual tracks? Record labels increasingly suspected the latter. The CD, formerly the staple of the music business, was being atomized by the ability to choose individual tracks. Meanwhile piracy and buyer indifference meant that, in 2003, the worldwide music business slumped again, by nearly 8 per cent year on year, to a total value of $32 billion. It was the trend, as much as the value, that was worrying. And, if every iTunes track sold for 99 cents meant a $10 CD forgone, that was very bad news.\n\nIn 2004 iPod sales really took off. In the first three months, sales were 10 times greater than in the previous year. The next quarter was only three times greater (but of course a year ago had seen the Oprah boost). Apple's revenues grew 17 per cent from $2 billion to $2.35 billion, but its profits rose 74 per cent from $61 million to $106 million. Something had happened. The iPod was handily profitable. The iTunes Music Store had enough scale that it was turning a profit on each song sold. Apple also got money from licences from companies hooking into its 30-pin dock to make tuners and 'docks' to play music.\n\nIn June, Jobs launched the iTunes Music Store in Europe \u2013 the UK, France and Germany. In the first week, 800,000 songs were downloaded, 450,000 of them in the UK. British companies I spoke to such as OD2, which had been plugging away at the digital download market for years \u2013 based on Windows Media files with DRM \u2013 and had seen Apple reduce it from market leader to also-ran in the matter of seven days, were resigned: they could see that they didn't have the brand to compete. Still, they were sure the iTunes launch would raise their profile.\n\nPhysical retailers had cause to worry too. Before then, about 500,000 to 700,000 CD singles were sold in UK shops each week. The iTunes Music Store UK had almost equalled them while still in its infancy. Music on the move, and over the internet, was being transformed.\n\nApple and the mobile phone\n\nAt the end of July 2004, Jobs announced in an e-mail to Apple staff that he had been treated for a rare form of pancreatic cancer. Most pancreatic cancers kill within six months. But Jobs had neuroendocrine cancer, a rare, treatable (and survivable) form, given the right treatment. (What Jobs didn't reveal was that he hadn't taken the right treatment; the cancer had been diagnosed the previous October, but he'd declined surgery until June.) Jobs worked from home after his treatment, and returned to the office occasionally later that summer before returning full time in October.\n\nIn that period he instituted a programme to build a mobile phone entirely designed by Apple, even though a parallel project to develop a phone with Motorola using flash memory to store songs was nearing completion. Jobs had let news of the work with Motorola leak out earlier in July, when he had"</details> | 1024 | Book | 72013 | 0.7592306891 | 1.7778053674 | 0.389687931 | 0.1577682059 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 5 | 4 |

Because how do you compete with free? Apple benefited, though: during Windows Mobile's glory year \u2013 July 2007 to June 2008 \u2013 Apple sold 5.41 million iPhones. In the next July\u2013June period, 20.25 million iPhones were sold, outselling Windows Mobile by more than 2 million.\n\nWebsites also began noticing that, while Apple's iPhone might be only a drop in the mobile ocean in terms of absolute numbers, iPhone users were very active mobile web users. Compared to the tens of millions of BlackBerry and Windows Mobile phone users, iPhone users seemed to spend enormous amounts of time browsing the web. The mobile internet really had begun to take off \u2013 and Apple had taken control of it. Google's deal to make itself the default search engine in the Mobile Safari browser soon looked like one of its smarter decisions: on Christmas Day 2007, people unwrapped iPhones and internet-enabled iPod Touches, turned them on and started using them. In the next 24 hours, despite being only a tiny fraction of the mobile devices in use, they drove more searches through Google than any other mobile. Inside Google \u2013 where information is treasured \u2013 it was more confirmation of the power of the mobile platform. And it meant that Rubin's Android project assumed more significance inside Google than ever.\n\nIt would also drive a wedge between Apple and Google.\n\nApps for all\n\nThe announcement of Apple's SDK for the iPhone created a storm of excitement among developers. The news that Apple would distribute 'apps' through a new segment of the iTunes Music Store \u2013 the iTunes App Store \u2013 and that it would vet every app first, and take 30 per cent of any purchase price, wasn't initially popular. But the alternative was to create a web page that you'd have to hope would display well, and run fast enough compared to native code, and also (if you wanted to make money) have some sort of effective payment system. Developers already knew they didn't want to develop web pages; that was what had driven the demand for an SDK in the first place. As for speed, a web page would rely on connectivity, while an app could store and cache images locally and just download data if needed \u2013 though many games wouldn't need a connection (and many developers were keen to write games). Just as games developers try to get 'as close to the silicon' as possible \u2013 that is, write in code that can be run directly by the processor, rather than having to be interpreted by other software \u2013 so with iPhone developers. The 70/30 revenue split was viewed as 'liveable', if not totally desirable.\n\nThe enormous merit of the App Store was visibility: it would be the only place to find apps, and anyone who had registered to buy songs or videos there would also be able to buy apps there in a zero-friction experience; they could even do it over the air, without going through their computer. The cost of entry was $99 for a listing, and the development software was Mac-only (which helped drive Mac sales; they began growing faster than the rest of the PC market, boosted by new would-be developers).\n\nApps faced many restrictions: they couldn't carry on running if they weren't directly on the screen \u2013 a move to save on memory and battery (but also, arguably, to prevent 'spy' applications that might watch your keystrokes and pass them off to a distant website). The user had no way to control which tasks or apps were running, because essentially there was only ever one app \u2013 the one the user was looking at \u2013 working at any time. In theory, you'd want a smartphone to be doing just as many things at once as you could. But this was reality, as Gruber observed:\n\nThe iPhone is severely resource constrained. Battery, RAM, and CPU cycles are all severely limited. If third-party apps could run in the background, all three could suffer. RAM would suffer for sure; all running apps consume memory. The iPhone has just 128MB of RAM, and no swap space. CPU performance and battery life would suffer when background apps do something \u2013 and if they're not doing anything, what's the point of keeping them running?\n\nWould-be developers weren't discouraged. Gruber's sources at Apple told him that 10,000 people and companies applied in the first fortnight.

Adobe publicly said that Flash would ship on a smartphone in early 2009, then the second half of 2009, then the first half of 2010, and now they say the second half of 2010. We think it will eventually ship, but we're glad we didn't hold our breath. Who knows how it will perform?\n\nThe key paragraph said:\n\nWe know from painful experience that letting a third party layer of software come between the platform and the developer ultimately results in sub-standard apps and hinders the enhancement and progress of the platform. If developers grow dependent on third party development libraries and tools, they can only take advantage of platform enhancements if and when the third party chooses to adopt the new features. We cannot be at the mercy of a third party deciding if and when they will make our enhancements available to our developers.\n\nApple later stripped Flash from its laptop computers too: if you needed to run Flash content, you had to download a browser plug-in. It was like 1995, when a fresh plug-in for the Netscape browser (always requiring a download and restart) seemed to sprout every week.\n\nTactically, the rejection of Flash was part of Apple's view of how the mobile internet would develop: that it would be app-driven, but those apps would be built to its own standards.\n\nTo some people, the refusal to include Flash in favour of HTML5 indicated that Apple was a closed platform. Jobs, and Apple, argued that it was giving people the chance to rely on the open standards of the web (harking back to Jobs's mid-1997 speech to developers). The corollary of this dispute was the question of whether the future of smartphones lies in apps or in 'web apps' (websites that offer the same functionality as a phone-installed app).\n\nDevelopers faced a conflict in trying to decide on this. If they chose the app route, they would have to write for multiple platforms, tweaking or even rewriting their code to work on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, and RIM'S BB6 or 7 or QNX. The advantage for 'native' apps was to be able to use all the power of the phone and feel integrated into it. A web app \u2013 a page viewed through the browser \u2013 would have the benefit of looking the same (or similar) on every platform, but without the functionality of a native app. There was no single answer. Matt Gemmell, a British iOS developer, summed up the conflict in a blog post in July 2011: the problem is always, he noted, that 'Apps, by virtue of running on devices which we're physically interacting with, have two frames of interaction: the app, and the device. You're reaching through a window to do whatever you're doing.' He compared running a calculator app (running on the machine) and running a calculator web app (running in a browser window): in one you are dealing almost directly with the app; in the second you have to reach through a window to touch the app. 'No matter how commonplace and mundane computers have become, we still exist in a physical world \u2013 and our experience continues to teach us that the best tools are dedicated,' he noted, before concluding: 'Native apps are the fortune of an ecosystem, and thus of a platform.'\n\nFor Apple, which has rebuilt its fortunes by building an ecosystem around its newest two platforms, that seems to be the lesson to apply: native apps are what bring people to the platform. By the middle of 2011, it had more than 450,000 apps available in its App Store. There's no way to count web apps; but, in terms of revenues earned on mobile, there was no indication that they might catch up.\n\nIn November 2011, amid the announcement of 750 job cuts, Adobe announced that it would cease the development of Flash for mobile. Mike Chambers of Adobe put it bluntly: 'given... the fact that one of the leading mobile platforms (Apple's iOS) was not going to allow the Flash Player in the browser, the Flash Player was not on track to reach anywhere near the ubiquity of the Flash Player on desktops'.\n\nBy contrast, he said, HTML5 'on mobile devices... has a level of ubiquity similar to what the Flash Player has on the desktop'. And keeping mobile Flash updated was consuming resources in dealing with handset mak"</details> | 1024 | Book | 72013 | 0.7674487417 | 0.4831809031 | 0.4632389207 | 0.3840874193 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

However, people also noticed that it had begun to insert paid results into searches, and at the bottom of maps \u2013 or 'more ways to interact with paid content', as Google put it.\n\nThe map wars produced Pyrrhic victories for each side. Apple suffered a significant blow to its reputation. But Google lost a lot of users. It never announced how many regular iOS users it had \u2013 although it must have known how many API calls it was getting.\n\nComScore showed that Google Maps hit a high in the United States of 81.1 million mobile users at the start of September 2012. Then iOS 6 arrived: the next month Google Maps had lost 9 million users, even though the total number of Android users had grown by 2.5 million, and of iPhone users by more than half a million.\n\nBy August 2013, ComScore's data showed that Google Maps on mobile had just 66.8 million users \u2013 fewer than a year before \u2013 even while the number of Android users had grown by 12.2 million, and of iOS users by 18.1 million, cumulatively reaching 133.8 million.\n\nApple's Maps, though, were the 10th most-used smartphone app that month, despite only being available on the iPhone; ComScore reckoned they had 39.9 million users. All were customers lost to Google. Extra data provided to me by ComScore suggests that there were about 7.8 million users of Google's maps on the iPhone \u2013 and only about 2.6 million who used it exclusively. Apple users hadn't rebelled.\n\nAnd the total number of maps users on both platforms in the United States alone was 101 million. Google could probably have had them all if it had allowed Apple to have voice-driven turn-by-turn access. The argument that its API licence forbade that doesn't hold. Big companies can, and do, make exceptions.\n\nNo wonder Google didn't talk about how well its Maps app had done on the iPhone; it hadn't. For a data-driven company, losing access to all that information from peoples' smartphones \u2013 and fewer users than a year before \u2013 was not success. Worse, it had brought the struggle with Apple \u2013 which was also being played out in parallel in the patent courts \u2013 to the notice of everyone. Apple had suffered a bloody nose over maps. But Google had lost what it craves: users and their data.\n\nThe revolution will be handheld\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2010, 100 million smartphones were sold worldwide, according to both IDC and Gartner. This is an impressive number, but even more impressive given that they had, for the first time, outsold PCs, which hit their own world record of around 93 million (the two companies offer slightly different figures: 93.5 million and 92.1 million). The trend continued in the first quarter of 2011: the PC market, it became clear, had begun to slow down, especially in the United States and western Europe. The only bright spots were in China, India and Latin America. In the first three months of 2011, PC sales actually fell year on year by 2 per cent to 84 million; smartphones kept roaring ahead, with another 100 million sold. It's an inflection point that won't be reversed. PC shipments overall peaked in the third quarter of 2011, at 96.1m, and then began to slide. By the end of 2013, they had fallen for six quarters in a row, and IDC and Gartner both expected 2014 to bring no recovery.\n\nFor Apple, getting more and more iPhone customers every quarter, the growth in smartphones is good news, and similarly for Google, whose Android customer base almost always opts into Google accounts and services (except in China, where it is effectively banned on mobile; local services dominate). But for Microsoft it's bad. PC sales are one leg of its profits \u2013 the others being Office and Server sales. If PC sales dwindle, so does Microsoft's Windows income. If smartphones forestall PC sales in places the PC has not yet reached \u2013 particularly developing countries \u2013 then Microsoft's future revenues and profits are endangered.

During the previous quarter it had written off $485 million on an estimated 2 million unsold PlayBooks \u2013 yet still made a profit. But the Christmas period had created problems, including another writeoff, this time of $267 million on its older BB7 handsets.\n\nThorsten Heins, the chief operations officer (equivalent to Tim Cook under Steve Jobs) who had taken over from Balsillie and Lazaridis in January 2012, announced that it would in future focus on its 'core strengths'. Balsillie resigned from the board, later revealing he had fought to make BlackBerry Messenger \u2013 the app which let BlackBerry phones send data cheaply and quickly between each other \u2013 a standalone, cross-platform app that would generate necessary income.\n\nBut the core had gone away. Within months Heins had to admit the company would lose money for another quarter. It became evident that Apple had taken away its clothes in the enterprise, and Android had done the same with low-end consumers. With its new BB10 software delayed to some time in 2013, the company had fallen into a downward spiral: it kept losing old customers, and couldn't gain enough new ones.\n\nNokia, meanwhile, didn't have it easy either. Elop's decision to announce Symbian's forthcoming death in January 2011, yet not have any Windows Phone handsets to sell, had a dramatic effect on the company's primary customers \u2013 the carriers. Six months after that announcement, and three months before it had any Windows Phone handsets to sell, Nokia too made an operating loss on its handset business. The next two quarters were profitable; then the money began bleeding out again.\n\nBy the end of 2012, both Nokia and RIM were trapped in a financial gravity well. According to Dediu's rule of thumb \u2013 which was quickly taking on the force of a law of nature \u2013 it was only a matter of time before each would succumb, either to a takeover, merger, or breakup.\n\nNokia's response, as it tried to pull itself out of the dive, was to differentiate itself through phone features such as wireless charging and high-quality cameras. At the launch of one handset, I asked Jo Harlow, its head of Windows Phone, why people should buy a Lumia device (its Windows Phone brand) rather than any other brand. She replied that the usage data Nokia collected indicated that people who bought them did so to use the camera \u2013 a feature where the company excelled.\n\nI mentioned this later to a senior Apple executive, who guffawed quietly, and said: 'That's because they don't have any apps.' Even three years after its launch, Windows Phone still didn't have some of the most popular, and many of the less popular (but fringe), apps. Among them were a native version of the photo-sharing service Instagram, now owned by Facebook, and Snapchat, a photo sharing service whose wrinkle made it hugely popular with teenagers: you sent the photo to a recipient \u2013 and then it wiped itself. Windows Phone had no native version, and had to rely on third-party bolt-ons.\n\nSo if Nokia thought the smartphone was about photos, what did Apple think the smartphone was for? 'A computer in your pocket,' the executive replied at once.\n\nIn mid-July, Nokia hit one mark: sales of Lumia phones for the three months to June outstripped those of BlackBerry. But it would be premature to call Windows Phone the third ecosystem; BlackBerry (as RIM had renamed itself in January, launching new phones with new software derived from the PlayBook's) still had around 70 million users. Nokia had sold fewer than 27 million Lumias over seven quarters. And the handset business was still losing money.\n\nThe spiral tightened. At the end of August 2013, Heins announced that BlackBerry's board had formed a special committee to examine options, including selling the business. The chairman, Prem Watsa, resigned in order to put together a bid \u2013 which emerged a few weeks later as an unfinanced, tentative $4.9 billion offer. Watsa had until 4 November to fin"</details> | 1024 | Book | 72013 | 0.7537519874 | 1.0364851347 | 0.0422229105 | 0.3892901598 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

That was only in the United States; it had just begun shipping to other countries \u2013 Japan, Germany, France, the UK, Italy, Spain, Canada, Australia and Switzerland. Yet in less than one quarter it had sold more than twice as many tablets as had previously been sold in a year.\n\nWhile many commentators kept dismissing the iPad as a fad, rivals scrambled to build their own. The problem was: what operating system should they build it on? Windows 7, despite being 'fully touch-enabled', really wasn't suitable: the icons were too small for finger control and the interface unwieldy. And hardware makers who used Windows 7 would have to pay the full licence cost of about $50 per device. A tablet that sold as well as the iPad would cost the maker $100 million in licensing fees before any profit.\n\nWhat about Windows Phone? Despite the fact that the Metro interface looked like the perfect form for a tablet, and would cost only $15 or so per machine, Microsoft turned requests down flat. It wouldn't say why. It didn't hint that it had a grand plan, and junior staff who interacted with the press weren't told there was a grand plan. It simply stonewalled.\n\nSo manufacturers turned instead to Android. In the race to manufacture, Samsung had a head start: having supplied some of the screens, it knew the specifications. Its first tablet, the Galaxy Tab, used Android 2.2 \u2013 the same as on many mobile phones \u2013 and a 7-inch screen (a 7-inch screen has half the area of a 10-inch one: the measurement is on the diagonal). Half the cost of the device is in the screen, so chopping that in half cut costs. Even so, it couldn't match Apple's price; despite being smaller, the Tab was more expensive.\n\nDespite the price gap, as more companies announced tablets there was the expectation that the tablet market would be a rapid repeat of the PC market: horizontal would beat vertical. In June 2010 Shantanu Narayen, chief executive of Adobe, told the AllThingsD conference what he expected: 'What you saw with smartphones hitting an inflection point with Android, you'll see it again with tablets,' he said. 'There will be another 20 tablets that will come by the end of the year that will push the industry in different directions.' He cited HP's webOS (the result of purchasing Palm in mid-2010) and RIM's PlayBook \u2013 a 7-inch tablet being developed in a crash programme rather like that for the BlackBerry Storm, whose hardware development was mostly outsourced to the Taiwanese computer assembler Quanta \u2013 as others that would certainly get enterprise take-up. Because it was enterprise adoption that had decided the PC's success, so it would surely be for tablets \u2013 wouldn't it?\n\nThe importance \u2013 or not \u2013 of Flash became a fresh topic of debate, just as on the iPhone. It was the only element separating Apple from rivals \u2013 that, and the fact that the iPad was selling in huge numbers. Did Flash matter? Apple said not. Adobe and the tablet manufacturers said yes: without it, videos on many news websites wouldn't play, advertisements wouldn't play, but YouTube and most other video sites would play fine, and news sites began converting their video output to work with the iPad too.\n\nBy the end of 2010 Apple completely dominated the tablet space; it had sold a total of 14.3 million, adding $9.5 billion to its revenues. And the hardware add-on ecosystem welcomed it with open arms, building iPad music docks, covers, sleeves and add-ons. Android tablet shipments (though not necessarily sales) were estimated at 2.5 million. By January 2011, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where Ballmer was once more giving the keynote speech, had acres devoted to Chinese manufacturing companies that seemed to be doing nothing but turning out iPad-compatible products. One company even had a profitable line in dummy iPads for displays; they were everywhere.\n\nAlways on\n\nThe iPad, and the tablet idea, wasn't important only for Apple. Along with the smartphone, it has profound implications for how computing might look in the future. Even a casual study of"</details> | 1024 | Book | 72013 | 1.0222083715 | 1.4483297084 | 0.6737469258 | 0.4465203057 | E | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

That uncertainty, mixed with Apple's juggernaut, led Carolina Milanesi at Gartner to forecast that the iPod-like dominance would continue as far as 2015, retaining a market share of over 50 per cent. 'Apple delivers a superior and unified user experience across its hardware, software and services,' she observed. 'Apple had the foresight to create this market and in doing that planned for it as far as component supplies such as memory and screen.' Windows 8's timing was a 'late arrival'; the best chance would be in business.\n\nShe also forecast that the number of tablets sold would grow from the equivalent of 5 per cent of PC sales in 2010 to 60 per cent by 2015. Half of PC sales are in North America and Europe, and are slowing dramatically, so if those figures are correct there might then be more tablet sales than PC sales in the West, although in her model less than 10 per cent of them would be Windows devices.\n\nThat would certainly be a post-PC era. Gates's prophecy would have come true \u2013 just a decade late.\n\nYet as so often with predictions, Milanesi was too pessimistic in some parts, too optimistic in others. Tablet sales blossomed, so that by the final three months of 2013 another company, IDC, was forecasting they would outsell PCs, 84.1m to 83.1m. (They fell short, 76.9m to 82.1m.) Apple did not retain its share; in the third quarter Apple's share fell to around 30 per cent as sales of small, cheap Android tablets took off in China and elsewhere in Asia.\n\nYet those tablets didn't quite seem to be replacing PCs, or forestalling PCs' purchase. Though PC sales kept slowing, especially in Asia, they seemed to be substituted by large-screen smartphones \u2013 dubbed 'phablets' \u2013 with screens of 5in diagonally or more. Many were produced at ultra-low prices \u2013 $50 or so \u2013 and sold in the Far East. Though classed as 'Android', they weren't running Google services because they were sold in China. A substantial proportion seemed to be used purely for 'content consumption', as had been expected early on.\n\nApple and Microsoft, though, had bigger ideas for the tablet. Microsoft wanted it to be a branch of the PC: its Surface Pro line, with Office onboard and a 'full' version of Windows, was intended to capture business interest. The iPad, meanwhile, gained more and more apps to make it useful in business and education. Schools began buying iPads for students to use; airlines and insurance companies followed suit. (Pilots could put huge amounts of paper documentation onto a single tablet; claims adjusters could take photos of damage with the tablet and upload a claim within minutes over the mobile network.) In some ways the tablet did less than a PC; in some ways, especially by integrating the camera and mobile functions, it could do more. What was clear was that it was not going away.\nChapter Seven\n\nChina\n\nFor years in the 20th-century China was a byword in the west for cheap and unreliable items: childrens' toys that fell apart within hours of being used, toxic paints, fakes. That began to change when the Chinese government decided that it should pursue economic growth, and the rise of factories and cities began to create a middle class as the population shifted from rural to urban areas, as had happened in the 1700s in Britain and the rest of Europe and North America with the Industrial Revolution.\n\nBy the late 1990s, China was competitive in a number of areas \u2013 and the burgeoning middle class meant that there were people who would require the new computing power on offer from PCs. The idea of a PC on every desk \u2013 or in every household \u2013 in a nation of a billion people was a mouth-watering thought for Microsoft. As with every company looking for fresh growth, it eyed China as an untapped market.\n\nMicrosoft was not the first big western company to perceive potentially huge benefits there. Nor was it the first to be disappointed by the reality of dealing with another culture and legal system than that prevalent in the West.

By being reminded on a near daily basis of what worked, Wiggins is more likely to do it again the next game.\nPerhaps no such film session was timelier than the one Mahlalela held after last week's win in Miami, where Wiggins recovered from a two-point first half to score 20 points in the second half. But in recent days, Wiggins has often struggled to replicate the step-back 3-pointers, forays toward the rim and stingy defense that fueled those sterling 22 minutes against the Heat.\nLittle more than a month ago, Wiggins hushed his critics by playing \u2014 and starting \u2014 his first All-Star Game. Now, with the Warriors mired in a 1-7 skid, those same naysayers have been quick to give him some familiar labels: unreliable, overrated, passive.\n\"They're going to love you, then they're going to hate you, then they're going to love you and probably hate you again,\" Wiggins said. \"That's how it goes. You've just got to wake up every morning just happy to be alive. There's bigger things to worry about.\"\nAndrew Wiggins (22) shoots over Devin Booker (1) as the Golden State Warriors played the Phoenix Suns at Chase Center in San Francisco, Calif., on Wednesday, March 30, 2022.\nCarlos Avila Gonzalez / The Chronicle\nAs Stephen Curry sits with a foot injury and Klay Thompson attempts to regain his two-way dynamism after a 2 \u00bd-year layoff, Wiggins looks like the player who was once a scapegoat for the Minnesota Timberwolves' dysfunction. On offense, he often settles for, and misses, jumpers early in the shot clock. Not long removed from receiving All-Defensive Team buzz, Wiggins is prone to ball-watching and slow closeouts.\nSuch regression at a critical time raises important questions: Was Wiggins' memorable first two-thirds of the season an outlier? Was it too soon to believe he has shed his unflattering reputation with Minnesota?\nWiggins and the Warriors have dismissed his recent slump as an unavoidable rough patch during an 82-game regular season. However, some outsiders believe Wiggins' issues hint as something more concerning.\nIn the first seven games after his All-Star Game start, he shot 4-for-14 (2"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 72029 | 0.0281664289 | -0.85083739 | -0.693762532 | -0.9426114176 | F | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |

At the time, head coach Steve Kerr was worried enough to pull Wiggins aside and get at the root of the problem.\nWiggins' foul shooting improved, but many of his other shortcomings lingered. He has averaged 15.2 points on 42% shooting since he was named an All-Star starter on Jan. 17 \u2014 down from the 18.5 points he averaged on 49% shooting before that.\nWith Curry sidelined indefinitely and Thompson rounding back into his pre-injury form, Wiggins has tried to be a go-to option, only to clang jumpers and look out of rhythm. In 13 March games, he shot 40.6% from the field (25.9% from 3-point range).\n\"I have faith in Wiggs,\" Kerr said recently. \"I think he's going to get this thing turned around. \u2026 I really do.\"\nGolden State Warriors' Andrew Wiggins and Stephen Curry react to a Wiggins' missed shot in 4th quarter of Dallas Mavericks' 107-101 win in NBA game at Chase Center in San Francisco, Calif., on Sunday, February 27, 2022.\nScott Strazzante / The Chronicle\nPerhaps even more vexing than Wiggins' offense, though, has been his defense. For much of the season he was a lockdown perimeter stopper \u2014 the type of long, agile wing who made life difficult on opponents' top scorers. But on numerous occasions in recent weeks, Wiggins has appeared uninterested at that end of the floor.\nHis 120.6 defensive rating over the past five games ranks 302nd out of 391 NBA players. Unlike offensive flow, which can depend on lineup combinations and timing, defensive success tends to come down to effort. Far too many times in recent weeks, Wiggins has focused on the ball instead of his man and barely jumped to contest shots.\nThis only reinforces the notion that he has yet to exorcise some of the bad habits that defined his 5 \u00bd-year stint with the Timberwolves. If Wiggins cannot return to an All-Star level soon, the Warriors might exit the playoffs early.\nDuring their 27-6 start to the season, he was one of their most dependable contributors \u2014 a versatile former No. 1 pick who defended all five positions and handled the ball when Golden State needed an offensive spark. The Warriors' decision-makers saw him as a better version of what Harrison Barnes was to their 2014-15 championship team.\nBut even then, history was working against Wiggins. Research indicates that, when a player is a minus-contributor for the first half-decade or so of his career, he typically remains a minus-contributor. After an underwhelming two-plus months from Wiggins, the Warriors are only marginally better this season with him on the floor than with him on the bench.\nHow Curry's 3-point shooting changed the game\nStephen Curry has not only led a Warriors resurgence since entering the league, he has changed the game with his long-distance shooting.\nWarriors World\nWarriors' Andrew Wiggins on recent slump: 'It's part of it'\nSigns of improvement for Warriors as Poole, defense shine in loss to Suns\nThis underscores an inescapable truth: Even if Wiggins delivers some big playoff performances, he is unlikely to figure in to Golden State's long-term plans. His next contract, which kicks in at the start of the 2023-24 season, likely would be too costly for a team faced with a ballooning payroll.\nAnd given Wiggins' warts, the Warriors would probably prefer to go all-in on Jonathan Kuminga, the promising 19-year-old whose recent surge has aligned with Wiggins' decline. But in the more immediate future, Golden State hopes Wiggins can be more effective in the playoffs than he was during his lone postseason series to date: a 2018 first-round loss with Minnesota in which he shot 33.3% from 3-"</details> | 1024 | CommonCrawl | 72029 | 0.1908153861 | -0.0866866429 | -0.1809662997 | -0.1674030776 | F | 5 | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 5 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 4 |
